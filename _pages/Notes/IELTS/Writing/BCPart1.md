### Task1 - 7分范文

The bar chart illustrates the estimated illiteracy rates by gender across different world regions last year. Developed countries are grouped together, while other regions represent developing or less developed areas.

Overall, South Asia recorded the highest illiteracy rate, followed closely by the Arab States and Sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, Latin America / the Caribbean and East Asia / Oceania reported significantly lower levels of illiteracy, with developed countries showing near-total literacy.

In South Asia and the Arab States, female illiteracy exceeds 50%, while in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is slightly below that figure. Meanwhile, male illiteracy rates in these regions are considerably lower, hovering around 30%. In East Asia and Latin America, the figures are much smaller, with female illiteracy slightly above 10% and male illiteracy below this threshold. Additionally, developed countries exhibit negligible illiteracy rates for both genders.

This data underscores the persistent gender gap in literacy, particularly in regions with lower economic development.

## Progress diagram

- The diagram below shows how glass is recycled.

![How Glass is Recycled](https://static.gelielts.cn/modules/writing_interface/ielts/assets/acw/Page-6-5.png)

### Task1 - 7分范文

The diagram illustrates the circular process of glass recycling, which consists of six stages and can be repeated many times.

It begins at home or the workplace where used glass bottles are collected in recycling bins, and ends in the supermarket, where newly recycled glass products are available for purchase. Once the glass bottles have been collected, they are transported to a treatment plant, where they undergo various processing stages.

First, the bottles are washed and sterilised using the washing and sterilise machine to ensure they are clean and free from microorganisms. Next, The clean bottles then are crushed and melted in high temperatures so that the glass is liquid. Once glass is melted, it is collected and placed into moulds to reshape it into bottles.

The final stage involves delivery of the final product to a supermarket, ready for consumers to buy it. The whole procedure starts again with the collection of used bottles.

### Task1 - 8分范文

The diagram illustrates the process by which glass can be recycled. The process is circular and involves six main stages.

Firstly, used glass bottles need to be separated from general household rubbish and placed in recycling bins. These bins are collected by a refuse lorry, which takes them to a treatment plant. At the treatment plant, the first step is to wash and sterilise the used glass in a special machine.

Once this has been done, the clean and sterile bottles are sent to a second machine where they are crushed and melted. The resulting molten glass is then reshaped into new glass products in a moulding machine. These new bottles can be filled and delivered to supermarkets for sale. The process may then be repeated all over again.

Overall, we can see there is no limit to how many times glass can be recycled and reused as long as consumers are prepared to take the initial step of separating glass rubbish from other household waste.

### Task1 - 9分范文

The diagram illustrates the cyclical process of recycling glass bottles, consisting of five key stages from disposal to redistribution in supermarkets. This closed-loop system efficiently repurposes used bottles, reducing waste and promoting environmental sustainability.

Initially, consumers dispose of used glass bottles by placing them into designated recycling bins. These are then collected and transported to a treatment plant, where they are thoroughly washed and sterilised to remove impurities and meet hygiene standards.

Next, the cleaned bottles are crushed into small fragments and melted in a high-temperature furnace. The molten glass is then moulded into new bottles of various sizes and designs. Once cooled and solidified, the newly formed bottles are thoroughly inspected to ensure they meet industry standards.

FIn the final stage, the bottles are carefully packed and distributed to supermarkets, where they are stocked on shelves and made available for purchase. Once used, they can be recycled again, maintaining the continuous nature of the process.

Overall, this glass recycling system minimises waste, conserves resources, and reduces reliance on raw materials. By transforming discarded bottles into reusable products, it significantly contributes to environmental sustainability.

## Map

- The two maps below show the changes that have taken place in the town of Westley since 1815.

![Page-16-test-15.png (775×412)](https://static.gelielts.cn/modules/writing_interface/ielts/assets/acw/Page-16-test-15.png)

### Task1 - 7分范文

The two pictures illustrate the map of Westley, the first from 1815, while the second image represents the layout of recent times. In the last 200 years, most of the original structure changed. Many old buildings were demolished and replaced by newer ones. However, the market square and old town hall remains the same.

As part of modernization, the woods were cut down, and fields were used to make space for business and residential areas, the extension of the roadsystem, and the construction of railway lines and a station. Additionally, the original road leading to London via the Twine Toll Bridge was removed and replaced by railroads.

To offer entertainment for villagers, a sports centre, cinema, shopping centre, and museum were built. As a result, compared to its former appearance, Westley lost much of its green landscape. Nevertheless, the central lake Lenton was preserved and continues being one of Westley's original features.

### Task1 - 8分范文

The two maps illustrate the transformation of Westley from 1815 to the present, showcasing its shift from a rural settlement to a modern, urbanized town.

Overall, the town has undergone extensive development, with the introduction of a railway, commercial and residential areas, and public amenities, significantly enhancing infrastructure and accessibility.

In 1815, Westley was a small village with a market square, town hall, church, and houses, surrounded by fields and Lenton Woods. The Twine Toll Bridge connected it across the River Twine, and a simple road network linked it to Titan Village. Lord Westley's house and The Coach Inn were notable landmarks.

Currently, the fields have been replaced by a business district and housing estate, while a railway station has been added, improving connectivity. The inn and Lord Westley's house have become hotels, and new facilities such as a sports centre, museum, and cinema have been introduced.

In summary, Westley has transformed into a developed urban centre, balancing modernization with existing structures.
