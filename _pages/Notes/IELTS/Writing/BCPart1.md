The bar chart illustrates the estimated illiteracy rates by gender across different world regions last year. Developed countries are grouped together, while other regions represent developing or less developed areas.

Overall, South Asia recorded the highest illiteracy rate, followed closely by the Arab States and Sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, Latin America / the Caribbean and East Asia / Oceania reported significantly lower levels of illiteracy, with developed countries showing near-total literacy.

In South Asia and the Arab States, female illiteracy exceeds 50%, while in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is slightly below that figure. Meanwhile, male illiteracy rates in these regions are considerably lower, hovering around 30%. In East Asia and Latin America, the figures are much smaller, with female illiteracy slightly above 10% and male illiteracy below this threshold. Additionally, developed countries exhibit negligible illiteracy rates for both genders.

This data underscores the persistent gender gap in literacy, particularly in regions with lower economic development.

The bar chart illustrates the estimated percentages of illiterate males and females across six regions worldwide for the previous year. Overall, the data shows that women experienced higher illiteracy rates than men in every region, with the largest differences found in developing areas.

South Asia reported the highest rates, with around 35% of men and 55% of women unable to read or write. Similarly, the Arab States and Sub-Saharan Africa exhibited significant gender gaps, where roughly 50% of women were illiterate compared to about 30% of men. In contrast, East Asia and Oceania had lower rates, with approximately 7% of men and 20% of women lacking literacy skills.

Latin America and the Caribbean presented more moderate figures, with both genders below 15%. Developed countries had the lowest illiteracy rates overall, with minimal gender differences, both remaining under 5%.

In summary, South Asia, the Arab States, and Sub-Saharan Africa showed the highest illiteracy levels, with women consistently more affected than men.

The bar chart illustrates the estimated illiteracy rates by gender across various world regions for the previous year. Overall, women had higher illiteracy rates than men in every region, with the gender disparity being particularly pronounced in developing areas.

South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa exhibited the highest illiteracy rates, with over half of the female population unable to read or write, compared to approximately one-third of men. The Arab States followed closely, displaying a similar trend of gender disparity, though at slightly lower levels. In contrast, East Asia and Oceania had moderate illiteracy rates, with women's rates at 20%, while male illiteracy remained below this threshold.

Latin America and the Caribbean recorded relatively low illiteracy rates (approximately 10%), with a minor gender gap, making them comparable to East Asia. Developed countries had the lowest levels of illiteracy (around 2%), with near-universal literacy for both men and women. These figures highlight the stark contrast between highly developed nations and those with limited access to education.

In summary, while illiteracy rates were consistently higher among women worldwide, the extent of the gender gap varied significantly by region. The most severe disparities were found in developing nations, whereas more developed regions showed minimal differences.

The two pictures illustrate the map of Westley, the first from 1815, while the second image represents the layout of recent times. In the last 200 years, most of the original structure changed. Many old buildings were demolished and replaced by newer ones. However, the market square and old town hall remains the same.

As part of modernization, the woods were cut down, and fields were used to make space for business and residential areas, the extension of the roadsystem, and the construction of railway lines and a station. Additionally, the original road leading to London via the Twine Toll Bridge was removed and replaced by railroads.

To offer entertainment for villagers, a sports centre, cinema, shopping centre, and museum were built. As a result, compared to its former appearance, Westley lost much of its green landscape. Nevertheless, the central lake Lenton was preserved and continues being one of Westley's original features.

The two maps illustrate the transformation of Westley from 1815 to the present, showcasing its shift from a rural settlement to a modern, urbanized town.

Overall, the town has undergone extensive development, with the introduction of a railway, commercial and residential areas, and public amenities, significantly enhancing infrastructure and accessibility.

In 1815, Westley was a small village with a market square, town hall, church, and houses, surrounded by fields and Lenton Woods. The Twine Toll Bridge connected it across the River Twine, and a simple road network linked it to Titan Village. Lord Westley's house and The Coach Inn were notable landmarks.

Currently, the fields have been replaced by a business district and housing estate, while a railway station has been added, improving connectivity. The inn and Lord Westley's house have become hotels, and new facilities such as a sports centre, museum, and cinema have been introduced.

In summary, Westley has transformed into a developed urban centre, balancing modernization with existing structures.

The two maps depict the transformation of Westley from 1815 to the present day. Overall, the town has evolved from a small rural settlement into a developed urban area with modern infrastructure and amenities.

In 1815, Westley was a modest town centered around a market square, surrounded by a grid of houses. To the north, Lord Westley's House was situated near Lenton Woods and Lake Lenton. A church was located close to the town center, while large open fields occupied the southern region. A coach road, connected by the Twine Toll Bridge, provided access to surrounding areas.

Currently, Westley has expanded significantly. The market square remains, but a cinema and a shopping center have been added. The coach road has been replaced by a railway with a station. The fields have been transformed into commercial and residential areas. New facilities such as a sports center, a museum, and hotels have been introduced. Although Lenton Woods and Lake Lenton remain, Lord Westley's House has been removed.

In summary, Westley has developed from a rural village into a modernized town with improved infrastructure, transportation, and public amenities.
