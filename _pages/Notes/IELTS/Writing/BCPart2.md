## Opinion

- There is a lot of pressure on young people today to succeed academically. As a result, some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from the school syllabus so that children can concentrate on academic work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

### Task1 - 7分范文

In today's globalized world, academic education has become a major topic of discussion. Some people believe that children should focus only on academic subjects and that non-academic subjects like physical education and cookery should be removed from the school curriculum. However, I strongly disagree with this view, as these subjects provide essential benefits for students.

One important reason why physical education should be included in schools is that it helps students maintain both physical and mental health. Regular physical activity improves concentration and reduces stress, allowing students to perform better in their academic subjects. For example, research has shown that students who engage in regular exercise tend to achieve higher grades compared to those who do not. Furthermore, if physical education is removed, students may not get enough exercise, leading to health issues such as obesity and fatigue.

Similarly, learning cookery is not just about making food; it is an essential life skill that helps individuals become more independent. Knowing how to cook allows people to prepare healthy meals instead of relying on unhealthy fast food. For instance, studies indicate that individuals who cook at home tend to have better nutrition and lower rates of obesity. Moreover, cooking skills can open career opportunities, as many high-paying jobs exist in the food industry, such as chefs and restaurant managers.

In conclusion, while academic subjects are important, physical education and cookery play a crucial role in students' overall development. Removing them from the curriculum would have negative consequences on students' health, independence, and future opportunities. Therefore, schools should continue offering these subjects to ensure a well-rounded education.

### Task1 - 8分范文

The pressure on young people to succeed academically is increasing. Consequently, some argue that non-academic subjects like physical education and cookery should be excluded from school curricula to allow students to focus solely on core subjects. I disagree with this perspective because such subjects contribute to both physical and mental well-being, as well as essential life skills.

To begin with, academic subjects are undoubtedly vital for future career opportunities. Mastering subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature is key to accessing higher education and well-paid professions. However, prioritizing only academic learning could negatively impact students' holistic development. Excessive academic pressure has been linked to increased stress, anxiety, and even burnout among teenagers, ultimately hindering their ability to perform well. If students are constantly overwhelmed with studies, they may lose motivation and struggle to retain information effectively.

On the other hand, non-academic subjects offer numerous advantages. Physical education not only improves students' physical fitness but also enhances concentration, which can positively influence their academic performance. Additionally, learning practical skills such as cooking fosters independence and prepares students for adulthood. Moreover, subjects like music, drama, or art provide creative outlets that boost self-confidence and emotional well-being, helping students cope with academic stress. Without such opportunities, students may struggle to develop social skills and creativity, which are essential for personal growth.

In conclusion, while academic subjects are crucial, removing non-academic subjects from school programs would be harmful. A well-rounded curriculum that balances both academic and non-academic subjects is essential for students' overall growth and long-term success.

### Task1 - 9分范文

In today's competitive world, academic success is often prioritized, leading some to argue that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from school curricula to allow students to focus entirely on core academic disciplines. While this perspective highlights the importance of academic excellence, I firmly believe that eliminating non-academic subjects would be detrimental to students' overall development. A balanced education system that incorporates both academic and practical subjects is essential for producing well-rounded individuals.

Supporters of this view argue that subjects like mathematics and science improve academic performance and job prospects. With a demanding job market, they believe prioritizing core subjects enhances university admission rates and career opportunities. Additionally, they claim that extracurricular activities can be pursued outside school, allowing students to focus exclusively on academics. However, this assumes all students have access to such activities, which is not always the case. Many families lack the financial resources to enroll their children in private sports clubs or art classes, widening the gap between privileged and underprivileged students.

Non-academic subjects, however, are essential for students' well-being and success. Physical education improves fitness, cognitive function, and concentration, benefiting academic performance. Cookery fosters self-sufficiency and promotes healthy eating habits, equipping students with practical skills they will need in adulthood. Moreover, creative subjects like music and drama develop emotional intelligence, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, which are highly valued by employers. Without these, students risk becoming overly focused on academic achievements at the expense of their personal growth.

In conclusion, while academic subjects are fundamental, non-academic disciplines are equally crucial. A well-rounded curriculum equips students with both knowledge and essential life skills, ensuring they thrive in their personal and professional lives. Therefore, non-academic subjects should remain a vital part of education.

## Direct question

- Some people argue that all experimentation on animals is bad and should be outlawed. However, others believe that important scientific discoveries can be made from animal experiments. Can experimentation on animals be justified? Are there any alternatives?

### Task1 - 7分范文

While modern technology is continuously developing, there is a controverse on scientific animal experimentation. Some people argue that many significant discoveries came from animal experiments, while other are convinced that they should be forbidden. From my point of view, I strongly believe that scientific experiments on animals are mandatory and justified before applying to humans.

One major interest of the scientific studies on animals is the possibility to try out a new method or product on different species of animals without risking human health. These experiments are very useful because the data obtained on tolerance and efficiency are preliminary results, that could be extrapolated to humans. However, if an adverse effect is observed, it warns the study investigator about some precautions to mention when using the evaluated product in humans. Moreover, in specific conditions, the product's development might even be stopped in case of major risks of negative effects are described.

It seems difficult to find alternatives to animal experimentation. Indeed, if we do not have the capacity to conduct a study on animal, it is very complicated to obtain information on a natural living organism. Even if it might be possible to modelized in computer chemical reactions, it will not be enough representative of the effects in the human body with its metabolism. So, in the actual state of the sciences, finding any alternatives remains interesting but very challenging.

To summarize, animal experimentations are debated but absolutely justified before using the evaluated product on humans. The quality of the information obtained is crucial to make the best decision for human health despite potentially having adverse effects on the animals.

### Task1 - 8分范文

The ethical implications of animal experimentation remain a contentious issue. While some argue that all testing on animals is cruel and should be banned, others contend that it is essential for scientific progress. In my opinion, although animal testing has led to significant medical advancements, it should be restricted to cases where no viable alternatives exist.

On one hand, experimentation on animals has played a crucial role in developing life-saving treatments. Many vaccines and medical procedures have been successfully tested on animals before being approved for human use. Without such research, progress in medicine and drug development would be significantly hindered. Additionally, animals share biological similarities with humans, making them reliable models for studying diseases. However, this does not mean that all forms of animal testing are justified. Many experiments, particularly those related to cosmetics and consumer products, cause unnecessary suffering and should be prohibited.

On the other hand, advancements in technology offer promising alternatives to animal testing. For example, computer simulations and artificial intelligence have become increasingly effective in predicting drug responses. Moreover, lab-grown human cells and organ-on-a-chip technology enable researchers to conduct experiments without causing harm to living creatures. While these alternatives are still developing, investing in their advancement could reduce reliance on animal testing over time. However, some scientific studies, particularly in neuroscience and immunology, still require live subjects, which makes a complete ban unrealistic at present.

In conclusion, although animal experimentation has contributed significantly to scientific progress, ethical concerns must be considered. It should only be used when necessary, and alternative methods should be prioritized to minimize animal suffering.

### Task1 - 9分范文

Animal experimentation remains a controversial issue. While some view it as inhumane, others argue it is essential for medical progress. Although animal testing has led to significant advancements, I believe efforts should be made to minimize its use by adopting alternative methods whenever possible.

Supporters emphasize its crucial role in developing treatments for diseases like cancer and diabetes. Without such research, many medical breakthroughs that save lives might not have been achieved. Additionally, testing ensures drug safety before public use, reducing harmful side effects. Some also argue that in cases where no viable alternative exists, controlled animal testing remains the most reliable option for understanding complex biological systems. Despite ethical concerns, they believe that prioritizing human health justifies its continued use, as long as strict regulations are in place to minimize suffering.

Critics argue that exposing animals to experiments is both cruel and ethically unjustifiable. They highlight that animals experience pain and distress, and sacrificing them for human benefit is morally questionable. Many also point out that with advances in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, researchers now have the capability to simulate human responses more accurately than animal testing ever could. Additionally, some countries have already implemented strict bans on certain types of animal testing, proving that scientific progress does not have to come at the expense of animal welfare.

In conclusion, while animal testing has played a significant role in medical advancements, ethical concerns and technological progress suggest it should be gradually phased out. As alternative methods continue to evolve, society must prioritize humane research approaches and work toward eliminating the need for animal experimentation altogether.

## Discussion

- Many believe that modern technology has brought people together, but others say that it has driven us apart. Discuss both viewpoints and give your own opinion.

### Task1 - 7分范文

Some people believe that advancements in technology have brought people closer together, while others argue that it has driven us apart. In my view, modern technology has significantly facilitated connections between individuals and strengthened social bonds, despite some concerns about its negative effects.

The rapid progress in technology, particularly in transportation and communication, has made it easier to connect with people across the world with minimal effort and time. For instance, traveling internationally now takes only a few hours, something unimaginable in the past. As a result, individuals can visit family and friends more frequently, strengthening personal relationships. Moreover, advancements in communication tools, such as mobile phones, video calls, and social media platforms, have further enhanced social connections. For example, people can now stay in touch instantly, regardless of geographical boundaries, making it easier to maintain friendships and family ties.

On the other hand, some argue that technology has led to increased social isolation. Many people, particularly the younger generation, spend hours on their devices instead of engaging in face-to-face interactions. Some individuals even feel that digital communication lacks emotional depth, as text messages and online conversations do not fully replace physical presence. Furthermore, excessive reliance on social media can lead to misunderstandings and weaken personal relationships.

In conclusion, modern technology has both benefits and drawbacks. While it has greatly improved global communication and strengthened connections, it is also essential to recognize the importance of in-person interactions. Maintaining a balance between digital and real-life relationships is key to fostering meaningful social bonds.

### Task1 - 8分范文

Modern technology has significantly enhanced interpersonal connections and strengthened social cohesion.
Advancements in transportation and communication have transformed how people connect, seemingly overnight. Modern transportation enables individuals to travel globally in hours, allowing families and friends to visit each other more frequently. Likewise, innovations such as smartphones and social media bridge geographical gaps, facilitating instant communication. Video calls, messaging apps, and social networking sites allow people to share experiences and maintain relationships more effectively than ever before.

Despite these benefits, critics argue that technology fosters social fragmentation by reducing face-to-face interactions. Some claim digital communication makes relationships feel superficial, with individuals only reaching out when they need assistance rather than out of genuine care. This perception raises concerns that technology weakens personal bonds.
For example, some families rely on text messages instead of spending quality time together. Likewise, social media interactions, while convenient, can sometimes replace deeper, more meaningful connections. The ease of digital communication may lead to less effort in maintaining relationships, causing emotional distance.

However, technology remains a powerful tool for fostering connections when used appropriately. It has enabled long-distance relationships to thrive, provided a means of support for individuals in isolation, and allowed people to maintain friendships despite busy schedules.

In conclusion, while technology has potential downsides, its advantages in strengthening social bonds outweigh its drawbacks. By overcoming geographical barriers and enabling constant communication, it has laid the foundation for more meaningful relationships. However, balancing digital and in-person interactions is essential to maintaining genuine human connections. This has always been the case.

### Task1 - 9分范文

In today's digital era, modern technology has profoundly influenced human interactions. While some argue that it enhances global connectivity, others believe it fosters social isolation. This essay will examine both perspectives before asserting that technology's benefits outweigh its drawbacks.

On the one hand, technological advancements have undeniably strengthened global connections. Social media, instant messaging, and video conferencing allow people to communicate instantly across vast distances. Families living apart can maintain strong bonds through platforms like Zoom and WhatsApp, while professionals collaborate seamlessly across time zones. Moreover, digital connectivity has enabled cultural exchange, exposing individuals to diverse perspectives and fostering global understanding. Additionally, access to online communities allows people to find support networks, particularly for those facing geographical or social barriers.

On the other hand, excessive dependence on technology can erode meaningful interpersonal relationships. Many individuals prioritize virtual interactions over real-life socialization, leading to weakened emotional connections. For instance, in numerous households, family members remain engrossed in their smartphones rather than engaging in face-to-face conversations. Furthermore, online interactions can create an illusion of connection, where relationships become superficial, and loneliness is exacerbated. Overuse of digital platforms may also contribute to social anxiety and reduced communication skills in real-life scenarios.

Despite these concerns, I believe technology's advantages in facilitating communication far outweigh its drawbacks. The key lies in mindful usage- leveraging digital tools to enhance, rather than replace, real-world interactions. If individuals set boundaries on screen time and prioritize in-person engagement, they can reap the benefits of global connectivity while preserving deep, meaningful relationships.

In conclusion, while technology has the potential to isolate, it serves as a powerful tool for connection when used responsibly. By maintaining a balance between online and offline interactions, people can harness technology's strengths without compromising authentic relationships.

## Problems and solutions

- Some species of animals are almost extinct; and many others seem to be fast approaching a similar risk. What are the reasons for this? What should be done to solve this problem?

### Task1 - 7分范文

Since the early 2000s many researchers have claimed that the extinction of some animals species relevant to nature is getting closer. Issues like overfishing and climate change put fauna in danger, which is why approaches are being followed to mitigate them.

First, overfishing in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans significantly reduced many fish species. According to National Geographic, the overfishing of tuna-like species in the last two decades created a notable problem in the seafood chain, affecting in a direct way the economy and feeding in many countries. Consequently, a set of countries addressed this issue by creating natural sanctuaries, in sea and land, for trying to rollback the damage. In fact, the Indonesian Fisherman Association (IFA) recorded a 50% increase of tuna five years after a sanctuary was created.

Simultaneously, climate change is putting in danger the survival of plenty of species. Take, for example, the koala. In 2020 one of the biggest wildfires recorded affected the Australian Outback, reducing the koala population around 60%. In accordance with the BBC climate change was responsible for the high temperatures that led to the fire. Although this being a more complex problem to mitigate, forming international aliances helps counter this challenge. For instance, laws developed by these organisms enforce a decrease in the carbon footprint of many countries, hence, diminishing the strikes climate change makes to animals.

To conclude, these challenges are complex to solve and affect in a direct way countless species, however, humankind is deploying solutions like natural reserves and international alliances to avoid the extinction of vital species for nature and humans.

### Task1 - 8分范文

The decline of various animal species has become a serious global issue, with some nearing extinction and many others at risk. This situation is mainly caused by human activities and climate change, but several measures can be taken to address the problem.

One major reason for species endangerment is habitat destruction. Deforestation for agriculture and urban expansion reduces the natural homes of animals, leaving them with fewer resources to survive. For example, the Amazon rainforest, home to countless species, is being rapidly cleared for farming. Similarly, pollution, particularly plastic waste in oceans, has harmed marine life, often leading to death.

Another contributing factor is illegal hunting and poaching. Many species, such as rhinos and elephants, are hunted for their horns and ivory, despite bans. This illegal trade continues due to high market demand, especially in certain regions. Additionally, climate change affects ecosystems, making it difficult for some species to adapt. Rising temperatures and extreme weather disrupt migration patterns and food sources, further pushing animals toward extinction.

To address this crisis, governments should strengthen laws against poaching and deforestation. Strict penalties must be enforced to deter illegal activities. Additionally, conservation programs, such as breeding endangered animals in protected areas, can help restore populations. Raising public awareness through education and media campaigns is also crucial, as people need to understand the consequences of their actions.

In conclusion, human activities and environmental changes are the key drivers of species extinction. However, with stricter regulations, conservation initiatives, and increased awareness, we can still prevent the disappearance of many species and preserve biodiversity for future generations.

### Task1 - 9分范文

The rapid decline of various animal species has become a pressing global issue, with some nearing extinction and many others at risk. This is caused by habitat destruction, climate change, and illegal wildlife trade. However, with targeted interventions, this trend can be reversed.

Deforestation, driven by urban expansion, industrial farming, and logging, is a leading cause of species loss. Destroying ecosystems deprives animals of food and shelter, pushing many toward extinction. Climate change exacerbates this by altering temperatures, weather patterns, and migration cycles, making adaptation increasingly difficult. Another major factor is poaching and illegal wildlife trade, which have devastated populations of species such as tigers and rhinoceroses. Additionally, pollution- particularly plastic waste and toxic chemicals- poses severe risks to both marine and terrestrial life, leading to habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity.

Addressing this crisis requires urgent, coordinated action. Governments must enforce strict environmental regulations, control deforestation, and invest in large-scale reforestation efforts. Expanding and effectively managing wildlife reserves can help restore ecosystems and provide safe habitats. Moreover, international collaboration is vital to combat poaching through harsher penalties, strengthened border security, and intelligence-sharing between nations. Public engagement also plays a crucial role- raising awareness about ethical tourism, reducing plastic waste, and promoting sustainable consumer choices can encourage responsible environmental behavior. Additionally, businesses should be incentivized to adopt eco-friendly practices, ensuring industries contribute to conservation rather than destruction.

In conclusion, while habitat destruction, climate change, and poaching pose severe threats to biodiversity, effective solutions exist. Through robust legislation, habitat restoration, international cooperation, and public awareness, we can prevent further species loss. Protecting biodiversity is a shared responsibility, and immediate action is essential to safeguard the planet's ecosystems for future generations.

## Advantages and disadvantages

- In some countries there are more young people choosing to enrol in work-based training instead of attending university.Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?

### Task1 - 7分范文

Nowadays, in some nations, many young people decide to take work-based training instead of studying in university. There are many reason for this choice, and it has both positive and negative impact. In my opinion, the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages.

First of all, one major benefit is that work-based training allows young people to gain practical skills which is very useful for future employment. Many companies prefer hiring candidates who already have experience rather than those who only have a degree. For example, in technical fields like plumbing or electrician jobs, practical experience is more important than theoretical knowledge. As a result, people who finish work-based training might find a job easier than university graduates.

Another advantage is that work-based training usually cost lesser than university education. Many students struggle with high tuition fees and student debts, which can take years to repay. If young people choose vocational training, they can start earning money earlier and become financial independent sooner.

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks. One big disadvantage is that people who do not attend university might have less career options in the future. Some high-paying jobs, such as doctors and lawyers, require a university degree. Furthermore, work-based training might not provide a broad knowledge base, which university education can give. This can limit individuals' ability to change careers later in life.

To conclude, while there are some disadvantages, I strongly believe that the benefits of work-based training are greater because it gives practical skills, makes job opportunities better, and reduces financial burden. Therefore, it is a good choice for many young people today.

### Task1 - 8分范文

In many countries, a growing number of young people are opting for vocational training rather than pursing university education. While some may argue that this trend could lead to a lack of highly educated professionals, I strongly believe the benefits outweighs the drawbacks.

Firstly, work-based training equips young people with practical skills that are directly applicable to the workforce. Unlike university education, which often emphasizes theory, vocational training allows individuals to gain hands-on experience and become employable much sooner. For instance, many technical jobs such as electricians, plumbers and mechanics are in high demand, and people who complete such training programs often secure well-paying jobs faster than those who spend years in university. Furthermore, it reduces the financial burden on students, as vocational courses are often shorter and less expensive compared to a degree programme.

Secondly, societies benefit from a balanced workforce when more young people enter trades and skilled labour positions. A country cannot function effectively with only university graduates, as industries such as construction, manufacturing and healthcare depend on trained workers. For example, Germany has a strong apprenticeship system that has contributed to it's low youth unemployment rate. By contrast, countries that prioritise university education sometimes experience an oversupply of graduates who struggle to find suitable jobs, leading to dissatisfaction and economic instability.

However, a potential disadvantage is that some careers require higher academic qualifications. Fields like medicine and engineering, for example, demand extensive theoretical knowledge that cannot be substituted by practical training alone. This could lead to a shortage of specialists in crucial areas if too many young people opt out of university education.

In conclusion, despite some concerns regarding a decline in academically qualified professionals, the advantages of work-based training, such as increased employability and economic stability, outweigh the disadvantages. A balanced approach, where both vocational and academic pathways are valued, would be most beneficial for societies worldwide.

### Task1 - 9分范文

In recent years, an increasing number of young individuals have chosen work-based training over traditional university education. While some argue that this shift limits career opportunities, others highlight its practical benefits and financial advantages. I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, particularly in today's evolving job market.

One of the main advantages of vocational training is its direct relevance to industry needs. Unlike university courses, which often emphasize theory over practice, work-based programs equip individuals with hands-on skills that enhance employability. This is particularly beneficial in fields such as construction, healthcare, and technology, where there is a high demand for skilled professionals. Moreover, vocational students enter the workforce earlier, gain financial independence, and avoid student debt, a growing concern in many countries. Additionally, businesses benefit from a skilled workforce, reducing the need for extensive training and boosting economic productivity. Countries like Germany and Switzerland have successfully implemented vocational systems, leading to low youth unemployment rates and a stronger economy.

However, one significant drawback is the limited career progression in certain fields. High-paying professions such as medicine, law, and engineering require university degrees, making it difficult for vocational trainees to switch careers later in life. Additionally, some argue that higher education fosters critical thinking and innovation, which may be less emphasized in skill-based learning. That said, many vocational courses now incorporate problem-solving and technical knowledge, bridging this gap. Governments can introduce flexible learning pathways that allow vocational students to pursue higher education later if desired.

Overall, while vocational training may not suit every profession, its practical approach, affordability, and alignment with industry demands make it a valuable alternative to university education. Governments should continue investing in vocational programs to ensure young people have diverse educational pathways for long-term career success.
