# Speaking2026年1-4月题库
## Part1
### View

- Do you prefer views in urban areas or in rural areas?
> I definitely prefer views in rural areas. Natural landscapes like mountains and rivers give me a sense of peace and help me relax. Urban views can be impressive too, but they often feel crowded and repetitive to me.

- Do you like taking pictures of different views?
> Yes, I enjoy capturing beautiful views with my phone camera, especially when I travel. It’s a simple way to preserve memories and share moments with friends. I don’t spend too much time editing though—I prefer keeping them natural.

- Do you prefer views in your own country or in other countries?
> I appreciate both, but views in my own country feel more familiar and meaningful to me. Still, I find foreign landscapes incredibly fascinating because they offer new perspectives and cultural experiences.

- Do you usually look for a room with a good view when you travel?
> If possible, I try to choose a room with a nice view, especially if it overlooks natural scenery. It makes my stay more enjoyable and memorable. However, if it’s too expensive, I don’t mind skipping it to save money.

### Life stage
- How do people remember each stage of their lives?
> People often remember different stages through photographs, keepsakes, or significant milestones like graduations. Sharing stories with family and friends also helps keep memories alive. Personally, I sometimes reflect by looking back at old journals or social media posts.

- What did you often do with your friends in your childhood?
> As a child, I used to play outdoor games like hide-and-seek or football with my friends in our neighborhood. We also enjoyed riding bicycles and exploring nearby parks together. Those simple activities created some of my happiest memories.

- What do you think is the most important at the moment?
> Right now, I believe personal growth and maintaining a healthy work-life balance are most important. Focusing on my studies and well-being helps me stay motivated. Also, spending quality time with loved ones is something I truly value.

- Do you have any plans for the next five years?
> Yes, I hope to complete my studies and gain some professional experience in my field. I also plan to improve my language skills and travel to a few new countries. Overall, I want to keep learning and exploring different opportunities.

- Do you enjoy being the age you are now?
> Generally, yes—I appreciate the independence and opportunities that come with my current age. There are more responsibilities, of course, but I feel capable of shaping my own path. It’s a good balance between youth and maturity.

- At what age do you think people are the happiest?
> I don’t believe there’s one specific age—happiness can come at any stage. Childhood is often carefree, while adulthood brings freedom and achievements. Many say retirement allows more time for hobbies and family. It really depends on the person and their circumstances.


### Building
- Are there tall buildings near your home?
> Yes, there are several tall office buildings and apartment complexes in my neighborhood. They are mostly concentrated around the business district, which is about a ten-minute walk from my home. I often see their modern glass facades reflecting sunlight during the day.

- Do you take photos of buildings?
> Sometimes, especially when I travel. I like photographing unique or historically significant buildings, like temples or modern landmarks. In daily life, though, I rarely take pictures of ordinary buildings unless the lighting or angle looks particularly striking.

- Is there a building that you would like to visit?
> Yes, I’d love to visit the Eiffel Tower in Paris one day. It’s not only an iconic structure but also offers a breathtaking view of the city. Experiencing its history and design in person would be unforgettable.

- Do you want to live in a tall building?
> I’m not sure—it depends. Living on a higher floor could provide nice views and more natural light. However, I might worry about relying too much on elevators or feeling isolated. For now, I prefer mid-rise apartments for a balance.

### Childhood activities

- What are your favourite activities?
> Well, I’d say I really enjoy staying active and exploring new things. I often go hiking on weekends because it helps me relax in nature. Besides that, I like reading—especially non-fiction—and occasionally meeting friends for coffee or a meal.

- What were your favourite activities when you were a child?
> When I was younger, I was very energetic and loved playing outdoors. I remember spending hours riding my bicycle around the neighbourhood with friends. I also enjoyed drawing and building things with blocks or Lego.

- Did you prefer to do activities alone or with a group of people when you were a child?
> Actually, I mostly preferred being with other children. Group games like hide-and-seek were much more fun with friends. But sometimes, I also liked playing quietly by myself, especially when drawing or building something creative.

- Are there any difference between the activities you liked when you were a child and those you like now?
> Yes, there are some clear differences. As a child, my activities were mostly about play and imagination, whereas now I lean toward hobbies that help me unwind or learn something new. Also, I’m more interested in solo or small-group activities now, rather than large, noisy games.

### Travel/Scenery

- Do you prefer the mountains or the sea?
> That's a tough choice, but if I had to pick, I'd say the mountains. I find the fresh air and peaceful hiking trails incredibly refreshing. Though, I must admit, a day by the sea is also wonderful for its own sense of calm.

- Do you like to take scenery pictures?
>  Yes, I do, but I'm not a professional. I often take quick photos on my phone when a view really strikes me—like a stunning sunset or a unique landscape. It's more about capturing a personal memory than perfect photography.

- Do you look out the window at the scenery when travelling by bus or car?
> Absolutely, I almost always do. I find it relaxing to watch the world go by, especially on longer journeys through the countryside. It's a nice way to pass the time and sometimes spot interesting places.

- What are the most beautiful sights you have seen while traveling?
> The most beautiful sight I've ever seen while traveling is the aurora borealis over the Hulunbuir Grassland. The colors of the aurora were incredibly vibrant, painting the night sky with hues of red, green and purple. It was an absolutely breathtaking experience that left me feeling completely awestruck and grateful.

### Typing
- Do you prefer typing or handwriting?
> Well, I definitely prefer typing over handwriting these days. It's simply much faster and more efficient for me to get my thoughts down, especially for longer texts. Plus, editing and correcting mistakes is a breeze, which saves a lot of time and effort.

- Do you type on a desktop or laptop keyboard every day?
> Well, yes, I definitely use a keyboard every single day, whether it's for work or personal tasks. It's pretty essential for my daily routine, especially for typing reports and communicating online. I've become quite fast at typing, which really helps me get things done efficiently.

- When did you learn how to type on a keyboard?
> Well, I first learned how to type on a keyboard during my primary school years, probably around the age of 8 or 9. It was part of our computer class, where we used educational software to practice finger placement and speed. I found it quite engaging and actually enjoyed those lessons a lot.

- How do you improve your typing?
> Well, I mainly improve my typing skills through consistent practice. I mean, it's quite essential for my daily work and studies, so I try to type regularly. Sometimes, I also use online typing tutors to refine my speed and accuracy.

### Pets and Animals
- What's your favourite animal? Why?
> Well, if I had to pick just one animal, I'd say I'm a big fan of dogs. I mean, they are incredibly intelligent and loyal companions, always there to greet you with a wagging tail. Their playful nature and unconditional affection really bring a lot of joy and companionship into people's lives.

- Where do you prefer to keep your pet, indoors or outdoors?
> Well, I definitely prefer to keep my pets indoors, especially since I live in an apartment. It's safer for them, and it allows me to spend more quality time with them. This way, they're always close by, and I can interact with them constantly.

- Have you ever had a pet before?
> Well, yes, I have had a pet before, specifically a lovely Toy Poodle named Seven. He was a very friendly and playful dog, always full of energy and eager to go for walks. I really enjoyed his companionship; he was truly a part of our family.

- What is the most popular animal in China?
> Well, I'd say dogs are probably the most popular animals in China, especially as pets. This is mainly because they are known for their loyalty and companionship, making them ideal family members. You can find them in almost every household, both in urban and rural areas.

### Sports team
- Have you ever been part of a sports team?
> Well, to be honest, I haven't really been part of an organized sports team. I've always preferred individual sports like swimming or running, which don't require a team setup. However, I do enjoy watching team sports and appreciate the camaraderie among players.

- Is team sports popular in your culture?
> Oh, absolutely! Team sports are incredibly popular in my culture, especially among young people. I think it's because they offer a fantastic way to promote teamwork and build strong friendships. For instance, football and basketball leagues are a really big deal here, drawing huge crowds.

- Do you like watching team games? Why?
> Absolutely, I'm a big fan of watching team games, especially sports like basketball or football. I find the teamwork and strategic play incredibly engaging, and the atmosphere is always electric. It's really inspiring to see athletes push their limits, and it's just great entertainment.

- What are the differences between team sports and individual sports?
> Absolutely, I'm a big fan of watching team games, especially sports like basketball or football. I find the teamwork and strategic play incredibly engaging, and the atmosphere is always electric. It's really inspiring to see athletes push their limits, and it's just great entertainment.

### Walking
- Do you walk a lot?
> Well, I'd say I walk quite a lot, especially since I don't own a car. It's a great way for me to stay active and clear my head after a long day. I usually walk to work, and on weekends, I enjoy taking longer strolls in the park.

- Did you often go outside to have a walk when you were a child?
> Well, yes, I certainly did enjoy going for walks quite often when I was a child. It was a fantastic way to explore nature and simply unwind from the day's activities. My parents would often take me to the local park where I'd spend hours playing and observing various things around me.

- Why do people like to walk in parks?
> Well, I think many people are really fond of walking in parks. It's mainly because parks offer a natural environment, allowing them to relax and escape from city life. They can enjoy fresh air and the sight of lush greenery, which is quite refreshing.

- Where would you like to take a long walk if you had the chance?
> Well, if I had the chance, I'd definitely choose to take a long walk along a beautiful coastline. The sound of the waves and the fresh sea breeze always help me relax and clear my mind. Especially during sunset, the vibrant colors in the sky would make it an absolutely breathtaking experience.

- Where did you go for a walk lately?
> Well, I actually went for a walk in a local park just last weekend. It's a really lovely place with lots of trees and a small lake, perfect for a leisurely stroll. I wanted to clear my head and enjoy some fresh air after a busy week.

### Reading
- Do you like reading?
> Absolutely, I'm a big fan of reading, especially when I have some free time to unwind. It's a fantastic way to relax and also to learn new things, whether it's fiction or non-fiction. I usually enjoy diving into a good novel before bed, which helps me clear my mind.

- Do you prefer to read on paper or on a screen?
> Well, I definitely lean towards reading on paper rather than on a screen, especially for longer texts. I find the physical sensation of holding a book and turning pages to be much more engaging, and it helps me concentrate better. Plus, staring at a screen for extended periods tends to strain my eyes, which is something I prefer to avoid.

- When do you need to read carefully, and when not?
> Well, I think I definitely need to read carefully when I'm dealing with academic papers or important contracts. On the other hand, I don't usually read carefully when I'm browsing social media posts or casual news articles online. The former requires precision and understanding, while the latter is more for quick information or entertainment.

- Do you prefer scanning or detailed reading?
> Well, I definitely lean towards detailed reading rather than just scanning. This is mainly because I enjoy fully grasping the content and absorbing information thoroughly. It simply enhances my overall reading experience, whether it's for studying or pleasure.

### Gifts
- Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?
> Oh, absolutely, I'm quite a fan of giving handmade gifts, especially for close friends and family. I feel they carry a lot more personal touch and sincerity compared to store-bought items. For instance, I often make personalized cards or small crafts for birthdays and special occasions.

- Have you ever received a great gift?
> Oh, absolutely, I've been fortunate enough to receive some truly wonderful gifts throughout my life. One that immediately comes to mind is a handmade scarf my grandmother knitted for me a few years ago. It's not just a scarf; it's a cherished keepsake that holds immense sentimental value for me.

- What do you consider when choosing a gift?
> Well, when choosing a gift, I primarily consider the recipient's preferences and interests. This is crucial because I want the gift to be genuinely useful and appreciated, rather than just a token. Also, I usually take into account my budget and the specific occasion to ensure suitability.

- Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?
> Well, to be honest, I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at choosing gifts, as it's something I often struggle with. I usually find it quite challenging to pick out the perfect present, often because I overthink what the recipient might genuinely like or need. My main concern is usually whether the gift will be practical and truly appreciated, rather than just being something to put aside.

- What gift have you received recently?
> Well, I recently received a coffee machine as a gift, which was a pleasant surprise. It was from a close friend for my birthday, and I've been wanting one for ages. It's incredibly practical and I absolutely love it.

### Morning time
- Do you like getting up early in the morning?
> Well, yes, I'm actually quite a morning person and really enjoy getting up early. It's usually the quietest part of the day, which allows me to focus and be productive without distractions. I often use this time for a quick workout or to plan my day ahead, which sets a positive tone.

- What do you usually do in the morning?
> Well, I usually wake up around 7 AM and the first thing I do is check my phone for messages and news updates. After that, I'll quickly get ready for work, which includes brushing my teeth and getting dressed. I find this routine quite efficient and it helps me start my day smoothly.

- What did you do in the morning when you were little? Why?
> Well, when I was little, my mornings often involved playing with my toys, especially building blocks or action figures. This was mainly because my parents would be getting ready for work, and I had some free time before they left. I really enjoyed creating different structures and imaginary worlds during that quiet time.

- Are there any differences between what you do in the morning nowand what you did in the past?
> Oh, absolutely, there are some pretty significant differences in my morning routine now compared to the past. Back then, I used to have a more relaxed start, often enjoying a leisurely breakfast and reading. However, these days, my mornings are much more structured and fast-paced, mainly due to work commitments.

- Do you spend your mornings doing the same things on both weekends and weekdays? Why?
> Well, not really, my morning routines differ quite a bit between weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, I'm usually rushing to get ready for work, but weekends are much more relaxed, allowing for a slower pace. I often enjoy a leisurely breakfast or even cook a bigger meal on Saturdays and Sundays.

### Hobby
- Do you have any hobbies?
> Yes, I do have a hobby, which is amateur radio communication. It involves setting up antennas and radio equipment to transmit and receive signals. I also enjoy learning new knowledge about electronics and communication theories.

- Did you have any hobbies when you were a child?
> Yes, when I was a child, my main hobby was photography. I used to take pictures of landscapes, especially during family trips. It gave me a great sense of joy to capture beautiful moments and preserve memories.

- Do you have a hobby that you’ve had since childhood?
> Yes, photography has been a hobby of mine since childhood. I enjoy it because it allows me to capture beautiful moments in life. Additionally, I love sharing my photos with friends and family.

- Do you have the same hobbies as your family members?
> No, I don't really share the same hobbies as my family members. However, we do often travel together, which is something we all enjoy. Besides traveling, we also like to cook meals together, especially during holidays.

### Keys
- Do you always bring a lot of keys with you?
> Well, not really; I usually only carry the essential ones with me. I prefer to keep my pockets and bag as light as possible. Plus, many places now use smart locks or keycards, so physical keys are becoming less necessary.

- Have you ever lost your keys？
> Well, yes, I have misplaced my keys on a couple of occasions, which was quite inconvenient. One time, I distinctly remember leaving them somewhere near my apartment building. It was really frustrating, as I couldn't get into my place for a while.

- Do you often forget the keys and lock yourself out？
> Well, not very often, but it does happen occasionally that I forget my keys and get locked out. I guess it's mostly due to being a bit absent-minded when I'm in a hurry or distracted. Usually, I have to call a family member or a friend to let me in, which can be quite inconvenient.

- Do you think it's a good idea to leave your keys with a neighbour?
> Well, I think it’s generally a good idea to leave your keys with a trusted neighbour. It offers peace of mind, especially for emergencies or when you're away on holiday, ensuring someone can access your home. However, it absolutely hinges on having a strong, trusting relationship with them.

## Part2 & Part 3
### 乐于助人的人

- Describe a person who often helps others. 
  You should say: 
  Who this person is? 
  How often he/she helps others?
  How/why he/she helps others? 
  And how you feel about this person?
> Well, I'd like to talk about one of my closest friends, Sarah, who truly embodies the spirit of helpfulness. She's incredibly kind-hearted and compassionate, always looking for opportunities to lend a hand. What I mean is, she's not just passively empathetic; she actively participates in various volunteer activities, which really sets her apart. One particular instance that really stands out to me is when she volunteered for the Asian Winter Games a few years ago. You know, it was a massive event, and the commitment required was immense, but she dedicated herself fully to ensuring everything ran smoothly. I was truly impressed and deeply moved by her dedication. It wasn't just about helping out; it was about her genuine desire to contribute to something bigger than herself and make a positive impact on the community. Her actions constantly inspire me to be more considerate and helpful in my own life.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我最亲密的朋友之一,莎拉,她真正体现了乐于助人的精神。她非常善良和富有同情心,总是寻找机会伸出援手。我的意思是,她不仅仅是被动的同理心;她积极参与各种志愿者活动,这确实让她与众不同。一个真正让我印象深刻的例子是几年前她志愿参加亚冬会。你知道,这是一个巨大的事件,所需的承诺是巨大的,但她全身心地投入,以确保一切顺利进行。她的奉献精神给我留下了深刻的印象和深深的感动。这不仅仅是帮助,这是关于她真正的愿望,为比自己更大的事情做出贡献,并对社区产生积极的影响。她的行为不断激励我在自己的生活中更加体贴和乐于助人。

- What can children do to help their parents?
> Children can help their parents in very practical ways. It doesn’t have to be something big.
When kids share small tasks, parents feel less stressed. It also makes the home atmosphere better.
There are two main ways. One is doing simple chores. The other is giving emotional support, like being considerate and communicating.
For example, they can wash the dishes, tidy up, or take out the trash. They can also check in on their parents and spend a bit of time with them.
> 我觉得孩子帮父母，其实可以从很具体的小事做起，不一定要做什么“大事”。
孩子分担一点小任务，父母就会省心省力，家里的氛围也会更好。
我觉得主要就两个方向：一是家务分担，二是情绪支持，比如主动沟通、少顶嘴、多体谅。
比如做一些简单家务，洗碗、收拾、倒垃圾都行。再比如多关心父母，问一句、陪一会儿，这些其实挺有用的。

- Should children help their parents with household chores?
> Yes, I think children should help with household chores, at least a little. It’s not about using kids as free workers. It’s about learning responsibility.
  Of course school is important, and kids get tired too. But if they never do any chores, they may grow up not knowing how to take care of themselves. They may also take their parents’ work for granted.
  For example, children can clean their own room. They can also do simple tasks like taking out the trash or washing dishes after dinner.
  When children help regularly, they become more independent. They also understand their parents better. That’s good for the family.
> 我觉得应该帮一点，至少做一些力所能及的家务。重点不是把孩子当免费劳动力，而是让他学会责任感和家庭分工。
当然学习也重要，孩子也会累。但如果从小完全不做家务，长大后很可能不会照顾自己，也容易把父母的付出当成理所当然。
比如孩子可以整理自己的房间，或者做一些简单的事，比如倒垃圾、饭后洗碗。
孩子长期参与家务，会更独立，也更能理解父母的辛苦。对家庭氛围也更好。

- What kind of help do people need when looking for a new job?
> When people look for a new job, they often need help with information and preparation. Some people also need connections, but the first two are the basics.
Many people are not bad at work. They just don’t know which jobs fit them. They also don’t know how to show their strengths in a clear way.
For example, they may need someone to improve their resume. They may also need a mock interview to practice answers.
With the right help, job hunting becomes faster and less stressful. Without it, people may apply randomly and feel more anxious.
> 我觉得找新工作最需要的帮助主要是信息和准备。有些人也需要人脉，但前两者是基础。
很多人其实不是能力不行，而是不知道哪些岗位适合自己，也不知道怎么把优势说清楚。
比如需要别人帮忙改简历；也可能需要做模拟面试，练练怎么回答。
如果有人指导，找工作会更快、更稳；但如果没人帮，很容易乱投，越找越焦虑。

- Who should people ask for help, colleagues or family members? 
> I think it depends on what kind of help you need. For work-related help, colleagues are usually better. For emotional support, family members are often better.
Colleagues understand your industry. They know what employers want, and they can give practical advice. Family can be very supportive, but they may not know the details. Sometimes they only say “don’t worry”, which doesn’t solve the problem.
For example, if you want feedback on your resume or interview answers, a colleague can help more. But if you feel stressed and you just need someone to listen, family is a better choice.
So I’d say choose the right person for the right problem. That saves time, and it also avoids awkward situations.
> 我觉得要看你需要什么帮助。跟工作相关的，通常问同事更合适；如果是情绪支持，家人往往更合适。
同事懂行业，也更清楚面试官想看什么，所以建议更实用。家人当然会支持你，但他们可能不了解细节。有时候他们只会说“别担心”，但问题还在。
比如你想让人看看简历、帮你改改面试回答，同事更能帮上忙；但如果你压力很大，只是想有人听你说几句，那找家人更好。
所以我会说：对事找人。这样更省时间，也能避免尴尬。

- Do you think schools should teach children to do household chores? 
> Yes, I think schools should teach children basic household chores. It’s very practical, and it helps kids become more independent.
For example, they can learn simple cleaning and how to keep their space organised. They can also learn basic cooking, like making an easy meal safely.
When kids know these skills, they rely less on their parents. They also understand responsibility and teamwork better. In daily life, they become more considerate at home.
So I don’t think it needs to take a lot of class time. Schools can do short workshops or simple hands-on activities.
> 我觉得学校应该教孩子做家务，至少把基础的教一下，真的很实用。
比如最基本的清洁、整理收纳这类，孩子都用得上。再比如教一点简单做饭，重点是安全，比如怎么用火、怎么用电。
孩子会这些技能之后，就没那么依赖父母了，也更懂责任和分工。在家里也会更体谅父母一点。
而且这事儿不需要占很多课时。学校用短课程或者实践活动带一下就够了。

- Why are employees reluctant to ask their managers for help?
> Many employees are reluctant to ask their managers for help because they worry about how they look. They don’t want to seem incompetent.
They may also fear it will affect performance reviews or promotion chances. And some people simply don’t want to bother their manager, so they try to handle everything alone.
For example, even when they’re stuck, they keep struggling and search online or ask colleagues first. They sometimes overthink the message too. They want to sound professional and avoid getting criticised.
But this can slow work down and cause rework. It’s often better to ask earlier and align expectations. It saves time and reduces mistakes.
> 我觉得很多员工不太愿意找经理求助，核心原因是怕“形象受损”，怕显得自己不行。
他们可能担心这会影响绩效评价、甚至影响晋升。还有的人是不想打扰领导，怕给人一种不专业、没能力的感觉，所以宁愿自己扛。
比如明明卡住了，也会先自己搜、先问同事，能拖就拖。发消息前还会反复纠结措辞，怕被怼、怕被批评。
但这样往往会让进度更慢，还容易返工。很多时候更好的方式是早点问、早点把预期对齐，反而更省时间也更稳。

### 花费超过预期的物品
- Describe an item on which you spent more than expected. 
  You should say: 
  What it is? 
  How much you spent on it? 
  Why you bought it? 
  And explain why you think you spent more than expected?
> Well, I'd like to talk about a second-hand Sigma wide-angle lens that I bought, which definitely cost me more than I initially expected. This particular lens is renowned for its exceptional performance in astrophotography, capturing stunning night sky images with incredible detail and clarity. I originally purchased it specifically for astrophotography, as I've always been fascinated by the cosmos and wanted to capture its beauty. I spent a bit more than planned because I was looking for a specific model that was hard to find used, and its condition was almost new, which justified the higher price tag. Ultimately, this lens has become more than just a piece of equipment; it has truly inspired me to explore new places and delve deeper into the art of photography, constantly pushing my creative boundaries. It's an investment that has paid off in experiences and personal growth.
> 好吧，我想谈谈我买的一个二手Sigma广角镜头，它的价格肯定比我最初预期的要高。这款特殊的镜头因其在天体.摄影方面的卓越性能而闻名，可以以令人难以置信的细节和清晰度 捕捉令人惊叹的夜空图像。我最初购买它是专门为了天文摄影，因为我一直对宇宙着迷并想捕捉它的美丽。我花的钱比计划多一点，因为我正在寻找一种很难找到使用过的特定型号，而且它的状况几乎是新的，这证明了更高的价格是合理的。 最终，这个镜头不仅仅是一件设备；它真正激励我探索新的地方，更深入地研究摄影艺术，不断突破我的创作界限。这是一项在经验和个人成长方面得到了回报的投资。

- Do you often buy more than you expected?
> Yes, sometimes I do, especially online. I often go in for one thing. Then I come out with three.
For example, I might buy some daily items first. Then I add snacks because they look tempting. Or I see “second one half price” and I buy an extra one.
Online shopping makes this easy. The app keeps showing “You may also like”. It also pushes deals and free shipping. It feels smart to add more, but it’s not always true.
Now I try to set a small budget. I also stick to a simple list. It helps me buy what I actually need.
会的，偶尔会，尤其网购的时候更容易。我经常本来只想买一件，最后变成买了三件。
比如先买点日用品，然后看到零食很诱人就加了；或者看到“第二件半价”，就顺手多买一份。
网购特别容易让人这样。它一直给你推“猜你喜欢”，还用折扣和包邮来刺激你。你会觉得多加点很划算，但其实不一定。
所以我现在会先定个小预算，也会写个简单清单。这样比较不容易越买越多。

- What do you think young people spend most of their money on?
> I think young people spend most of their money on two things. One is basic living costs. The other is daily entertainment.
Living costs are hard to avoid. Rent, food, and transport take a big part of the budget, especially in big cities.
After that, many young people spend on things that make life feel better. They pay for streaming or game memberships. They also spend money on social life.
For example, rent plus takeout can already be a lot. And some people also buy subscriptions or go out with friends on weekends.
So money goes fast. Saving becomes harder. But at the same time, these things help them relax and stay connected.
我觉得年轻人花钱最多的主要就两块：一块是生活成本，一块是日常娱乐。
生活成本很难躲开，尤其在大城市。房租、吃饭、通勤会占掉很大一部分预算。
剩下的钱，很多人就会花在让自己“过得舒服一点”的东西上，比如会员、游戏，或者社交活动。
比如光是房租加外卖就已经很贵了；然后有的人还会买各种订阅，或者周末和朋友出去吃饭。
所以钱真的花得很快，存钱会更难。但这些支出也能带来放松和社交，不完全是坏事。

- Do you think it is important to save money? Why?
> Yes, I think saving money is important. It gives you peace of mind. Life has surprises, and you don’t want to panic when something happens.
For example, you might get sick or your phone breaks. These small problems can become big stress if you have no savings. Another example is changing jobs. If you want to quit, some savings can give you a buffer.
Saving also makes you feel more in control. You can make choices more calmly. You don’t have to say yes to every job or every situation just because you need money right now.
So I think saving matters, but it should be realistic. Keep an emergency fund first, and then enjoy life with the rest.
我觉得存钱是重要的，因为它会给人安全感。生活总会有意外，你不想一出事就慌。
比如突然生病，或者手机坏了，这种小事如果你没存款就会变成大压力。再比如你想换工作，如果手里有点储备，就能有缓冲，不用被迫硬撑。
存钱也会让人更有掌控感，做决定更从容。你不需要因为“马上缺钱”就对所有情况都只能点头。
所以我觉得存钱重要，但也要现实一点。先把应急钱存出来，剩下的再去享受生活。

- Do people buy things they don’t need?
> Yes, people do. It happens a lot, especially with online shopping.
For example, someone watches a short video and suddenly wants the same product. Or they see a “limited-time sale” and add extra items to the cart.
Many purchases are not real needs. They are more about feelings. People buy things when they are stressed or bored. They want a quick reward. Apps also push products all the time, so it’s easy to click “buy”.
The problem is the happiness is short. Later, people may regret it, and the extra stuff piles up. It also makes saving money harder.
会的，而且挺常见的，尤其网购更容易发生。
比如刷到一个种草视频，突然就想买同款；或者看到“限时折扣”，就顺手在购物车里多加点东西。
很多消费其实不是刚需，而是情绪。压力大、无聊的时候，人就想奖励自己一下。再加上平台一直推推荐，点一下就买了。
问题是快乐很短，之后可能就后悔，而且东西会越堆越多。钱也花得更快，存钱就更难了。

- Do you think it is the rich people’s responsibility to donate money to people in need?
> I don’t think it should be treated as a strict responsibility. But I do think it’s a good thing for rich people to donate.
They have more resources, so their money can make a real difference quickly. It can also support charities and help society run more smoothly.
However, if donating becomes moral pressure, it can backfire. People may do it just for image, or they may even try to avoid it.
So I think the best way is to encourage voluntary giving. At the same time, we need clear rules and transparency, so donations actually reach people in need.
我不觉得这应该被当成一种“必须承担的责任”，但我确实认为富人捐款是件好事，也应该被鼓励。
他们资源更多，所以捐款可能更快、更直接地帮到需要的人，也能支持公益机构，让社会运转更稳定一些。
但如果把捐款变成一种道德绑架，反而可能适得其反。有人会为了形象做表面功夫，甚至有人会更反感、更想躲。
所以我觉得更合理的是：以自愿为主，同时用制度去引导，比如透明的公益机制、合理的税收和监管，让帮助更持续、更有效。

- What kind of things are people happy to pay a high price for?
> People are happy to pay a high price for things that feel truly worth it. Usually it’s about peace of mind and long-term value.
When something is expensive but reliable, people worry less. They also feel the experience is better, so the price seems justified.
Two big areas are education and health. Education can improve your skills and your future options. Health-related spending can make you feel safer, because you’re taking care of your body.
So it’s not just about buying a product. People are paying for confidence, comfort, and a better future.
我觉得大家愿意花高价的东西，往往是那种“价值感很强”的。
价格高一点但品质靠谱，人会更放心，也更省心，用起来体验更好，就会觉得值。
一般最典型的两类就是教育和健康。教育能提升能力，也能带来更好的机会。健康相关的支出会让人更安心，因为是在照顾身体。
所以大家买的不是单纯一个东西，而是安全感、舒适感，以及一种更好的未来预期。

### 鼓励别人做不愿做的事

- Describe a time when you encouraged someone to do something that he/she didn't want to do.
  You should say:
  Who he or she is?
  What you encouraged him/her to do?
  How he/she reacted?
  And explain why you encouraged him/her to do it?
> Well, I'd like to talk about a time when I encouraged my friend, Sarah, to do something she was really hesitant about. She was reluctant to apply for a scholarship because she was terrified of failure, having faced a few setbacks in the past. I tried to encourage her by sitting down and analyzing the potential reasons for failure, not to dwell on them, but to strategize how to overcome them. I also reminded her of her strengths and past achievements, emphasizing that this was a valuable learning opportunity regardless of the outcome. To my delight, she eventually submitted her application, and even better, she actually won the scholarship! I was incredibly proud of her for stepping out of her comfort zone and facing her fears. It was a truly rewarding experience to see her succeed and grow.
> 嗯,我想谈谈有一次我鼓励我的朋友莎拉做一些她真正犹豫的事情。她不愿意申请奖学金,因为她害怕失败,过去也遇到过一些挫折。我试图通过坐下来分析失败的潜在原因来鼓励她,不是纠缠在它们上,而是制定如何克服它们的策略。我还提醒她自己的优势和过去的成就,强调无论结果如何,这都是一个宝贵的学习机会。令我高兴的是,她最终提交了申请,更好的是,她竟然赢得了奖学金!我为她走出舒适区并面对恐惧感到无比自豪。看到她成功和成长是一次真正有益的经历。

- How can leaders encourage their employees?
> Leaders can encourage employees by giving real recognition and real support. Empty slogans don’t help much.
For example, they can praise people for specific work, either in public or in private. They can also set clear goals and provide the tools people need. When someone does well, a small reward or a new opportunity can be a strong push.
It also matters how leaders communicate. Feedback should be clear and specific. And employees need room to grow, so it’s okay to make small mistakes sometimes.
When people feel valued and supported, they usually work harder. They also take more responsibility. The team becomes more stable, and it’s easier to keep good staff.
我觉得领导想鼓励员工，最有效的是“认可+支持”，比喊口号更有用。
比如员工做得好，可以当众表扬，也可以私下肯定，而且最好说具体哪里做得好。再比如给清晰的目标和必要的资源，让人知道怎么做、用什么做。表现好的时候给点小奖励，或者给更多机会，也会很鼓舞人。
另外沟通方式也很关键，反馈要清楚、具体。员工也需要成长空间，所以允许小范围试错，会让人更敢做事。
当员工觉得自己被重视、被支持，他们动力会更强，也更愿意承担责任。团队效率会更稳定，留人也更容易。

- When should parents encourage their children?
> Parents should encourage their children at key moments. It’s not only after they succeed.
When encouragement comes at the right time, kids become more willing to try. They’re also less afraid of failing. If parents only praise results, children may get anxious and avoid mistakes.
I think it’s better to encourage the process, like effort and progress. Parents can also step in when a child feels low. It helps the child calm down first.
For example, after a bad exam, parents can praise the effort and then talk about a better plan. And when a child gets stuck learning a new skill, parents can notice their persistence and break the task into smaller steps.
我觉得父母应该在一些关键时刻鼓励孩子，而不是只在孩子成功之后才夸。
鼓励给得及时，孩子会更敢尝试，也不那么怕失败。如果父母只盯结果，孩子可能会更焦虑，更怕犯错。
我更倾向于鼓励过程，比如努力、进步这些，让孩子知道自己方向没错。孩子状态低落的时候，父母也应该托一把，先把情绪稳住再说。
比如考试考砸了，父母可以先肯定努力，再一起聊怎么改进。孩子学新技能卡住时，也可以先夸他坚持，然后把任务拆小一点，让他更容易继续下去。

- What kind of encouragement should parents give?
> I think parents should give encouragement that is specific and honest. It works best when it focuses on effort and progress.
Sure, parents can praise results too. But it’s better not to only say things like “You’re so smart.” That kind of praise doesn’t teach kids what they did right.
If parents only give empty compliments or only care about scores, kids may feel a lot of pressure. Some kids even stop trying new things because they’re scared of failing.
So the best encouragement is clear feedback plus a small next step. Tell the child what improved, and suggest what to do next. That helps them build real confidence.
我觉得父母的鼓励最好是具体、真诚的，而且重点放在努力和进步上。
当然也可以夸结果，但别只夸“你很聪明”。那种夸法容易让孩子不知道自己到底做对了什么。
如果父母只给空夸，或者只盯分数，孩子压力会很大。有些孩子会变得更怕失败，反而不敢尝试新东西。
所以更好的鼓励是：给清楚的反馈，再给一个小的下一步。告诉孩子哪里进步了，然后建议接下来怎么做，这样自信会更稳。


- Do you think some people are better than others at persuading?
> Yes, I do. Some people are simply better at persuading than others.
They usually understand people. They listen first, and they know what the other person cares about. Then they explain their point clearly and calmly. It feels natural, not pushy.
If someone just keeps pushing or lecturing, it often backfires. The other person gets defensive, and they stop listening.
The good news is persuasion is a skill. You can train it. If you practice listening and speaking in a clearer way, you’ll get much better over time.
我觉得是的，确实有些人比别人更擅长说服。
他们通常很懂人，会先听对方在乎什么、卡点在哪，然后再用更清楚、更冷静的方式把观点讲出来。听起来就很自然，不会让人觉得被硬推。
反过来，如果一个人一直强推，或者像上课一样讲大道理，往往会适得其反。对方会立刻进入防御状态，反而更不想听。
好消息是，说服力其实是可以练的技能。学会倾听，再把表达结构化一点，大多数人都会慢慢变强。

- Should children do everything their parents ask them to do?
> No, I don’t think children should do everything their parents ask. But they should still respect their parents and listen most of the time.
Parents usually have more experience, and many requests are about safety and good habits. In those cases, it makes sense to follow them.
However, if a child always obeys without thinking, it can be harmful. They may not learn to make decisions, and they can be easily influenced by others.
So the better approach is communication. Parents should explain the reason, and children should ask questions politely. For rules about safety, kids should follow. For personal choices, they should have some space.
我觉得不应该“什么都照做”，但同时也要尊重父母，该听的还是得听。
父母一般经验更多，很多要求其实是为了安全和习惯，这种情况下听了通常没坏处。
但如果孩子永远只会服从，不动脑子，就会出问题。他们很难学会做决定，也更容易被别人带偏。
所以更好的方式是沟通。父母解释清楚理由，孩子也礼貌地提问。安全类的规则要听，个人选择类的事情应该给孩子一些空间。

- How can employers encourage their staff?
> I think employers can encourage staff by making them feel valued and supported.
Pay matters, but money alone isn’t enough. People also want recognition and growth.
For example, managers can praise good work in a specific way. They can also offer training or resources, so employees feel they can improve.
When staff feel appreciated, they usually work with more energy. They’re also more likely to stay, and the team atmosphere becomes better.
我觉得雇主鼓励员工，最有效的是让员工感觉“被看见、被支持”。
钱当然重要，但光靠加薪不够，认可感和成长空间也得跟上。
比如做得好要及时表扬，而且最好表扬得具体一点。再比如提供培训或资源，让员工感觉自己在进步。
员工一旦觉得被重视，动力通常会更足，也更愿意留下来，团队氛围也会更好。

### 近期观影
- Describe a movie you watched and enjoyed recently.
  You should say:
  When and where you watched it?
  Who you watched it with?
  What it was about?
  And explain why you watched this movie?
> Well, the movie I'd like to talk about is "Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles," which is a classic detective film. I watched it recently at home, actually, just last weekend, on a cozy Saturday evening. It's essentially a captivating mystery story about Sherlock Holmes investigating a legendary curse and a mysterious death on the gloomy moors of Dartmoor. I thoroughly enjoyed it because the plot was incredibly engaging, full of suspense, and the characters were brilliantly portrayed.
> 好吧,我想谈论的电影是《夏洛克·福尔摩斯:巴斯克维尔的猎犬》,这是一部经典侦探电影。我最近在家里看了它,事实上,就在上周末,在一个舒适的周六晚上。这本质上是一个引人入胜的悬疑故事,讲述了夏洛克·福尔摩斯在达特穆尔阴沉的荒原上调查传奇诅咒和神秘死亡的故事。我非常喜欢它,因为情节非常引人入胜,充满悬念,而且人物也被出色地描绘。

- What kinds of movies do you think are successful in your country?
> In China, I think a successful movie is either story-driven or very enjoyable to watch. People pay for a good feeling, not just a famous name.
If the story is strong, people talk about it and recommend it. If the cinema experience is great, people feel it’s worth the money. But if a film only has hype, the interest drops fast after the first week.
For example, comedies and family movies often do well because they are easy to enjoy. Big action or sci-fi films can also be successful, because they look much better on a big screen.
So for me, a “successful” movie is simple. It has to be good inside, and it has to feel worth the ticket.
在中国，我觉得成功的电影通常就两种：要么故事特别抓人，要么观影体验特别爽。大家买票不是为了“看看明星”，而是为了那种观影感受。
如果故事够强，大家就会聊、就会安利；如果大银幕体验够好，观众会觉得值。反过来，如果只是靠营销炒热度，第一周过了就很容易降温。
比如喜剧和家庭片往往比较容易出圈，因为轻松好看；大制作的动作或科幻也容易成功，因为放在电影院确实更震撼。
所以我理解的“成功”很简单：内容要撑得住，而且看完要觉得值回票价。

- What are the factors that make a successful movie?
> I think a successful movie needs a strong core, like a solid story, believable characters, and good pacing. These are the things that keep people watching.
If a film only relies on flashy visuals or a big marketing push, it’s easy to forget. People may watch it once, and that’s it. 
When the characters make sense and the emotions build naturally, viewers get invested. Acting and music can also lift the whole experience.
That’s why truly successful movies spread through word of mouth and stay popular longer.
我觉得一部电影要成功，首先得有“硬核内容”，比如故事扎实、人物可信、节奏舒服。这样观众才会一直看下去。
反过来，如果它主要靠大场面或者营销，内容又撑不住，那基本就是看完就忘。很多人只看一次就结束了。
当人物动机清楚、情绪铺垫自然，观众会更投入。演员和配乐也能把整体氛围顶上去。
所以真正成功的片子往往是靠口碑传播，而且能火得更久。

- Do Chinese people prefer to watch domestic movies or foreign movies?
> I don’t think Chinese people always prefer domestic or foreign movies. Most people choose based on the genre and the word of mouth.
If a movie is genuinely good, people will pay for it. They’ll also recommend it to friends.
But if it’s just average, people won’t buy a ticket. They don’t really care where it’s made.
In general, stories that feel close to daily life in China work well as domestic films. For a strong visual experience, many people go for big Hollywood action movies.
我不觉得中国人一定更偏国产或者更偏国外。更多时候大家就是看类型和口碑。
电影真好看，观众就愿意掏钱。看完还会顺手安利给朋友。
但如果就一般般，观众也不会买账。这个时候是哪国拍的其实不重要。
通常贴近国内日常生活的故事，看国产会更容易代入。要是想追求视觉冲击，很多人就会去看好莱坞动作大片。

- Do you think only well-known directors can create the best movies?
> Not really. I don’t think only well-known directors can make the best movies. Fame doesn’t equal quality.
Well-known directors do have advantages. They have bigger budgets and stronger teams. They can also attract good scripts and top actors more easily.
But if we only trust famous directors, we leave no space for new talent. We might also miss unexpected “dark horse” movies.
In the end, the movie itself matters most. New directors can create masterpieces, and famous directors can still make a bad film.
我不太同意，只有知名导演才能拍出最好的电影。名气不等于质量。
当然名导确实有优势，比如预算更大、团队更成熟，也更容易拿到好剧本和好演员。
但如果我们只认名导，新人就很难被看见，观众也可能错过一些黑马作品。
所以最后还是回到作品本身。新人也能拍出神作，名导也可能翻车。

- Do you think successful movies should have well-known actors or actresses in leading roles?
> Not necessarily. A successful movie doesn’t have to rely on famous leads, but big names can help.
Well-known actors can bring attention. They can also make it easier to sell tickets at the start. But long-term success depends on the story and performance, not just fame.
For example, big commercial films often use stars to play it safe. It helps with the opening box office. But some small films with new faces still go viral, because the characters feel real and the plot is strong.
So I’d say stars are a bonus, not the core. Casting should be about fit. The lead needs to match the role.
我觉得不一定必须用大牌主演，但大牌有时候确实会加分。
知名演员能带来关注度，也更容易让电影一开始卖得动票。但电影能不能真的成功，还是看故事和表演，而不是靠名气硬撑。
比如商业大片用明星更稳，开局票房通常更好。但也有小成本电影用新人照样出圈，因为角色很真实、剧情够扎实。
所以我更倾向于：明星是加成，不是核心。选角更应该看的是“适不适合这个角色”。

- Why do people prefer to watch movies in the cinema?
> I think people go to the cinema because the experience feels more immersive. The big screen and the sound system make a huge difference.
It’s also easier to focus there. The lights are off and your phone isn’t supposed to be out. You get pulled into the story much faster.
At home, it’s the opposite. You pause for messages, snacks, or random chores. Even a small interruption can break the mood.
So for a lot of people, the cinema just hits differently. They pay for that “full experience,” and it usually feels more satisfying.
我觉得大家更爱去电影院，主要是因为体验更沉浸。大屏幕加上音响，带来的冲击感在家里很难复刻。
而且在电影院更容易专注。灯一关，你基本不会一直刷手机，很快就能被剧情带进去。
在家看就相反了。你会随时暂停回消息、拿零食、做点杂事，哪怕一个小打断都可能把氛围搞没。
所以对很多人来说，影院的感觉就是更“到位”。花钱买的是完整体验，整体也更容易觉得值。

### 有趣的建筑
- Describe an interesting building.
  You should say:
  Where it is?
  What it looks like?
  What function it has?
  And explain why you think it is interesting?
> Well, when it comes to an interesting building, the first place that springs to mind is, without a doubt, the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. It's an iconic landmark that truly captivates anyone who visits. This magnificent complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site, served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It's a sprawling architectural marvel, encompassing nearly a thousand buildings with vibrant red walls and golden-tiled roofs, all meticulously arranged according to traditional Chinese cosmology. What truly fascinates me about the Forbidden City is the myriad of stories embedded within its walls, particularly those concerning the daily lives and political intrigues of the Ming and Qing emperors. You know, imagining the grand ceremonies, the intricate court affairs, and the personal dramas that unfolded there really brings history to life. Each hall and courtyard seems to whisper tales of power, ambition, and sometimes, profound solitude. Visiting the Forbidden City left me with an overwhelming sense of awe and deep respect for ancient Chinese architecture and craftsmanship. It's not just a collection of buildings; it's a profound testament to a rich cultural heritage and the incredible ingenuity of its creators. It truly is a place where history breathes.
> 嗯,说到有趣的建筑,首先想到的地方无疑是中国北京的紫禁城。这是一个标志性地标,真正吸引了任何来访的人。这座宏伟的建筑群被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产,曾是明、清两代24位皇帝的皇宫。这是一个庞大的建筑奇迹,包含近一千座建筑,拥有充满活力的红色墙壁和金色瓷砖屋顶,所有这些都按照中国传统宇宙观精心排列。紫禁城真正让我着迷的是它的城墙里蕴藏着无数的故事,尤其是那些有关明、清皇帝的日常生活和政治阴谋的故事。你知道,想象那里发生的盛大仪式、错综复杂的宫廷事务以及个人戏剧,确实让历史栩栩如生。每个大厅和庭院似乎都在低声讲述权力、野心的故事,有时甚至是深刻的孤独。参观紫禁城让我对中国古代建筑和工艺产生了压倒性的敬畏和深深的尊重。它不仅仅是一群建筑;它是丰富的文化遗产及其创造者令人难以置信的独创性的深刻证明。它确实是一个历史呼吸的地方。

- What types of buildings are popular in your country?
> In China, high-rise apartments are probably the most popular, especially in big cities. They are common because land is limited, so building upward is more practical.
Also, city life is built around convenience. People want to live close to subways, schools, and shopping areas. Apartments usually have these things nearby, so they fit daily life.
For example, many people live in high-rise apartment buildings in large cities. In suburban areas, some families prefer townhouses or houses with small gardens.
So it depends on location. Apartments are popular for convenience, while houses are popular for space and comfort.
在中国，我觉得最普遍、最受欢迎的还是城市里的高层公寓，尤其大城市特别明显。主要原因很现实：地少人多，只能往上盖。
而且城市生活本来就讲究方便，大家都想离地铁、学校、商场近一点。公寓楼通常配套更集中，日常生活会更顺。
比如很多人住的就是高层商品房/公寓楼；但在郊区，一些家庭会更喜欢联排或者带小院子的房子。
所以看地点。想图方便，多数人选公寓；想要空间和舒适，就更偏向郊区的房子。

- Is it worth spending a lot of money on the exterior appearance of a building?
> Spending a lot on the outside can be worth it, but it shouldn’t be the first priority.
A good-looking building can leave a strong impression. It can also attract people, especially for public places. But if the inside is uncomfortable, the beauty doesn’t help much.
For example, for a shopping mall or a landmark building, the exterior matters. It brings visitors and improves the image. But for normal homes, I think money should go to comfort first, like better insulation or soundproofing.
So yes, design matters, but balance matters more. A building should look nice and work well at the same time.
外观花很多钱有时候值，但它不该是第一优先级。
好看的建筑确实会给人很强的第一印象，也更容易吸引人，尤其是公共空间。但如果里面住着不舒服，那外面再漂亮也没太大意义。
比如商场或者地标建筑，外观确实重要，能吸引人、提升城市形象；但普通住宅我觉得更该先把钱花在舒适度上，比如保温、隔音。
所以外观设计当然重要，但更重要的是平衡：好看，也要好用、好住。

- Is it more important for a building to look good on the outside or on the inside?
> For most buildings, I think the inside is more important. People spend time inside, so comfort matters more than looks.
The outside still matters, of course. A nice exterior gives a good first impression. It can also make a city look better. But if the inside is dark, noisy, or badly designed, people won’t enjoy the place.
For example, for a home, things like good lighting and soundproofing are key. For public buildings like malls or museums, the exterior can attract visitors. But the inside must be easy and pleasant to use.
So I’d say the exterior is a bonus. The inside is the real value.
我觉得对大多数建筑来说，里面更重要。因为人真正待着、生活、使用的地方是在里面，舒服和实用才是核心。
外观当然也重要，它决定第一印象，也会影响城市看起来的感觉。但如果里面很暗、很吵、布局很别扭，那外面再好看也留不住人。
比如住宅最关键的是采光、隔音这些；像商场或博物馆，外观好看能吸引人，但里面得好逛、好用。
所以我会说：外观是加分项，里面才是硬实力。

- Why do people like to visit historical sites?
> I think people visit historical sites because they want a real feeling of the past. Reading a textbook is one thing, but seeing the place in person feels different.
Historical sites also have a special atmosphere. People like walking around old buildings and imagining what life was like before. It’s also a good way to take photos and enjoy a slower pace.
For example, visiting an old town or an ancient temple can feel very peaceful. Another example is walking on an old street and seeing the original buildings.
After the visit, people often understand history better. They may also feel more connected to the culture of the city.
我觉得大家喜欢去历史遗址，很多时候不是为了“学习多伟大”，而是想获得那种真实的历史感。书上看是一回事，亲眼看到完全是另一回事。
历史遗址也很有氛围。你在老建筑里走一圈，很容易去想象以前的人怎么生活。它也适合拍照打卡，而且节奏会慢一点，能换换脑子。
比如去古城或者古寺走走，会觉得很安静；再比如逛老街，看那些老房子和生活痕迹。
逛完之后，很多人对那段历史会更有概念，也会更有城市文化的连接感。

- Do you think it's reasonable to charge an entry fee for visiting interesting buildings?
> Yes, I think it’s reasonable, but only if the fee is justified.
Historic or interesting buildings cost money to maintain. Safety checks, repairs, and staff all need funding. If everything is totally free, places can get overcrowded. The building may also get damaged faster.
For example, old buildings often need regular restoration and security. Popular sites may also need crowd control and basic guided services.
So charging a fee can improve the experience and protect the place. But the price should be transparent and fair. Discounts for students or locals can also make it feel more acceptable.
我觉得合理，但前提是这个钱“收得有道理”。
很多有特色的建筑，尤其是历史建筑，维护和安全都要花钱，比如修缮、安保、消防检查等。如果完全免费，可能人会特别多，既拥挤也更容易加速损耗。
比如老建筑经常需要定期修复，还得配安保。很火的建筑也需要限流，有时还会提供一些基础讲解服务。
所以收费能提升体验，也能保护建筑本身。但价格要透明、别离谱。给学生或本地人一些优惠，也会更合理。

- Is it better to live in a new building or an old one?
> I’d choose a new building. It’s simply less stressful.
Everything is newer, so there are usually fewer problems. Safety standards are also more up to date, so you feel more secure.
For example, the wiring and plumbing are new, so you’re less likely to deal with leaks or sudden issues. Soundproofing and building security are often better too. That makes daily life quieter and easier.
Overall, a new building gives you a more stable living experience. You spend less time fixing things, and you can focus on your own life.
我会选新房，主要就是更省心。
新房各方面都更新，出问题的概率更低，而且安全标准也更新，住着更踏实。
比如电路和管线更新，漏水、跳闸这种糟心事会少很多。隔音和门禁也往往更好，日常会更安静、更安心。
总的来说，新房的居住体验更稳定，不会老是消耗你的时间和精力，你可以把注意力放在自己的生活上。

### 发挥想象力
- Describe a time you needed to use your imagination.
  You should say:
  When it was?
  Why you needed to use imagination?
  How difficult or easy it was?
  And explain how you felt about it?
> Well, I vividly recall a particular instance during my university days when I participated in the National University Electronic Design Competition, often referred to as NUEDC. This was a time when my imagination was truly put to the test. The primary challenge was the immense time pressure; we had only four days and three nights to conceptualize, design, and build a fully functional prototype. It was a daunting task that required not just technical skill but also a significant amount of creative thinking. To overcome this, I had to really stretch my imaginative muscles. I spent countless hours brainstorming unique design solutions, sketching out unconventional approaches, and envisioning how different components could interact in novel ways. It wasn't about following a textbook solution, but rather about innovating under pressure to create something truly original and effective. Ultimately, our hard work and imaginative problem-solving paid off. Our final product not only met the competition's requirements but also impressed the judges enough to win first prize. I remember feeling an immense sense of accomplishment and elation, knowing that our creativity had led to such a successful outcome.
> 嗯,我清楚地记得大学时代的一个特殊例子,当时我参加了一场电子设计竞赛,通常被称为NUEDC。这是我的想象力真正受到考验的时刻。主要的挑战是巨大的时间压力;我们只有四天三夜的时间来概念化、设计和构建一个功能齐全的原型。这是一项艰巨的任务,不仅需要技术技能,还需要大量的创造性思维。为了克服这个问题,我必须真正伸展我想象力的肌肉。我花了无数个小时集思广益独特的设计解决方案,勾勒出非常规的方法,并设想不同的组件如何以新颖的方式交互。这不是遵循教科书中的解决方案,而是在压力下进行创新,以创造真正原创和有效的东西。最终,我们的辛勤工作和富有想象力的问题解决得到了回报。我们的最终产品不仅满足了比赛的要求,而且给评委留下了足够的印象,赢得了一等奖。我记得我感到巨大的成就感和自豪感,因为我知道我们的创造力导致了如此成功的结果。

- Do you think adults can have lots of imagination?
> Yes, adults can have a lot of imagination. I’m pretty sure about that.
If adults had no imagination, many things wouldn’t work. New products wouldn’t appear, and many daily problems would stay unsolved.
For example, people in product or marketing roles need fresh ideas all the time. They have to plan new campaigns and write new content. Also, many adults use imagination at home. They find smart ways to organize things and save time.
So I think adults do have imagination. It’s just more practical. It’s used to solve problems, not only to play.
我觉得成年人当然也能很有想象力，这点我还挺确定的。
反过来想，如果成年人真的没想象力，很多东西其实就运转不起来。新产品很难做出来，很多生活里的麻烦也解决不了。
比如做产品或运营的人要不断想新活动、新文案；还有很多人在家里也会动脑子，比如想办法收纳、想办法省时间。
所以我觉得成年人不是没想象力，而是更“实用型”。它更多用来解决问题，而不是单纯拿来玩。

- Do you think imagination is essential for scientists?
> Yes, I think imagination is essential for scientists. But it has to work with evidence.
Science is strict. Scientists need data and careful tests. At the same time, they need imagination to ask new questions. They also need it to think of possible explanations.
For example, a scientist may first guess what is happening. Then they design an experiment to check it. Without that first guess, they may not know where to start.
So imagination helps scientists explore new directions. Evidence helps them stay correct. Both are necessary.
我觉得想象力对科学家是必要的，但它必须和证据一起用。
科学需要严谨，需要数据和实验。但如果没有想象力，就很难提出新问题，也很难想到新的解释。
比如科学家可能先大胆猜一个可能原因，然后再设计实验去验证。如果没有这个“先猜一下”，很多时候都不知道从哪开始查。
所以想象力负责开新路，证据负责把关，保证结论靠谱。两个都需要。

- What kinds of jobs need imagination?
> Many jobs need imagination, not only art jobs. Any job that needs new ideas or new solutions needs it.
For example, designers and content creators need to come up with fresh ideas all the time. Another example is product or marketing work. People often face new problems, and they need to think of a plan.
If a job has no clear answer, imagination becomes more important. It helps you try new ways and find what works.
With imagination, you can stand out and solve problems better. Without it, you may just copy others, and your work feels replaceable.
我觉得很多工作都需要想象力，不只是艺术类。只要工作需要新点子、新办法，就离不开想象力。
比如设计师、内容创作者要一直想新创意；还有产品或营销，经常遇到新情况，你得想方案、想活动。
一般来说，越是没有标准答案、变化越多的工作，就越需要想象力去“试路子”，看看什么能行。
有想象力的人更容易做出差异，也更会解决问题；但如果只会照搬，就很容易显得可替代。

- What subjects are helpful for children's imagination?
> I think subjects that encourage creating and expressing ideas are the most helpful for imagination.
Art and writing are obvious examples. Kids can draw what they imagine, and they can make up stories. They don’t need one “correct” answer.
But science can also help. In a good science class, children ask “what if” questions. They make a guess first, and then they test it with a simple experiment.
These subjects train kids to think in different ways. They also make kids more confident about sharing ideas.
我觉得最能帮助想象力的学科，通常不是那种靠死背的，而是会逼孩子去创造、去表达的。
美术和写作就很典型。孩子可以把脑子里的画面画出来，也可以编故事，而且不一定只有一个“标准答案”。
但科学课也能帮想象力，前提是上得好。孩子会问很多“如果……会怎样”的问题，先猜一下，再用小实验去验证。
这些学科会训练孩子用不同方式思考，也会让他们更敢表达自己的想法。

- What games help develop children's imagination?
> Games that develop imagination are usually open-ended. There isn’t just one correct way to play.
In these games, kids create their own stories and rules. They have to think creatively, and they also learn to express ideas.
Two great types are role-play and building games. Role-play lets children pretend and act out different characters. Building games like blocks or LEGO let them design and invent things.
The key is giving them space. Adults shouldn’t control every step. If kids can explore freely, their imagination grows faster.
我觉得最能培养孩子想象力的，是那种开放式游戏，没有唯一正确答案。
在这种游戏里，孩子会自己编故事、自己定规则。这样他们就会更会创造，也更会表达想法。
我觉得最典型的两类就是角色扮演和搭建类。角色扮演比如过家家，孩子会自己设定人物和情节。搭建类比如积木或乐高，他们会设计、拼出自己脑子里的东西。
关键还是给空间，别每一步都指挥。孩子能自由探索的话，想象力会长得更快。

- How important is imagination to children?
> I think imagination is very important for children. It’s not just about having fun.
It helps them learn better. When kids can imagine, they understand stories and pictures more easily. It also helps with problem-solving, because they can think of different ways to do things.
With imagination, children are usually more confident to express themselves. They also try new things more willingly, so they adapt faster.
So I think we should protect it. Give kids time to play and explore. Don’t interrupt too much, and don’t force one “right answer” all the time.
我觉得想象力对孩子非常重要，它不只是“会玩”这么简单。
它会让孩子学得更顺，比如理解故事、图画会更快。它也能帮孩子解决问题，因为孩子能想到不同的做法，不会只卡在一种思路里。
有想象力的孩子通常更敢表达，也更愿意尝试新东西，所以适应变化会更快。
所以我觉得我们应该保护孩子的想象力。给他们时间去玩、去探索，别老打断，也别总逼他们找唯一正确答案。

### 自行车/摩托车/汽车旅行
- Describe a bicycle/motorcycle/car trip you would like to go.
  You should say:
  Who you would like to go with?
  Where you would like to go?
  When you would like to go?
  And explain why you would like to go by bicycle/motorcycle/car?
> Well, if I had to pick a trip I'd love to go on, it would definitely be a self-driving tour across the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. I mean, the idea of exploring such vast natural beauty at my own pace is incredibly appealing. Specifically, I envision driving the Hulunbuir Grassland loop. This route is renowned for its breathtaking scenery, offering endless stretches of green, clear skies, and a chance to experience the unique nomadic culture. The highlight of this dream trip would be encountering natural phenomena like the aurora borealis or the Perseid meteor shower. Imagine parking the car in the middle of nowhere, far from city lights, and witnessing such celestial displays. That would be absolutely unforgettable. Ultimately, the special significance of this trip for me lies in experiencing the sheer grandeur of nature. It's about disconnecting from the hustle and bustle of daily life and reconnecting with the raw, untamed beauty of our planet. It promises to be a deeply rejuvenating and inspiring journey.
> 好吧,如果要我选择一个我想去的旅行,那绝对是穿越蒙古草原的自驾游。我的意思是,按照我自己的节奏探索如此广阔的自然美景的想法非常有吸引力。具体来说,我设想驾驶呼伦贝尔草原环线。这条路线以其令人惊叹的风景而闻名,提供无尽的绿色、清澈的天空,以及体验独特的游牧文化的机会。这次梦想之旅的亮点是遇到北极光或英仙座流星雨等自然现象。想象一下,将车停在远离城市灯光的荒郊野外,并目睹这样的天体表演。那绝对是难忘的。归根结底,这次旅行对我来说的特殊意义在于体验大自然的壮丽。这是关于摆脱日常生活的喧器,重新与我们星球原始、未驯服的美丽建立联系。这将是一次充满活力和鼓舞人心的旅程。

- Which form of vehicle is more popular in your country, bikes, cars or motorcycles?
> In China, I’d say cars are the most popular overall. Many families have one, and it’s the main choice for long trips and family travel.
But in big cities, bikes and motorcycles are also very common. They are cheaper, and they are easier to park. They’re great for short distances and the “last mile”.
For example, people may drive to work if they live far away. But they might use a shared bike or an e-bike to get from the subway to home.
So it depends on the situation. Cars are more popular in general, but two-wheel vehicles are very practical in cities.
在中国，我觉得总体上还是汽车更普遍。很多家庭都有一辆，跑长距离或者全家出行基本还是靠它。
但在大城市里，自行车和摩托车（包括电动车）也很常见。它们更便宜，也更好停车，短距离和“最后一公里”特别方便。
比如住得远的人可能会开车通勤；但从地铁到家这段路，很多人会骑共享单车或者电动车。
所以还是得看场景。整体汽车更主流，但在城市里两轮车确实更实用。

- Do you think air pollution comes mostly from mobile vehicles?
> Not mostly, in my opinion. Vehicles are a big part, especially in cities, but they are not the only source.
In busy urban areas, exhaust is easy to notice. You can smell it near main roads, and it gets worse during rush hour. So people naturally think cars are the main cause.
But air pollution also comes from factories, power plants, and even construction dust. In some places, these sources may be bigger than vehicles.
So I think we need a mixed solution. We should control industrial pollution, and we should also reduce traffic pollution by using public transport and cleaner cars.
我觉得不完全是。车辆确实是重要来源之一，尤其在城市里，但它不是唯一来源。
在大城市车多，尾气特别明显。你在主干道旁边能闻到味道，早晚高峰更严重，所以大家会觉得“车就是主要原因”。
但空气污染也来自工厂、发电厂，甚至还有施工扬尘。在一些地方，这些可能比车辆更关键。
所以我觉得解决办法也得是组合拳：工业污染要管，同时也要通过公共交通和更清洁的汽车来降低交通污染。

- Do you think people need to change the way of transportation drastically to protect the environment?
> Yes, people need to change how they travel, but it doesn’t need to be drastic.
Most people still need transport every day. They go to work and they take care of family things. So we need realistic options, not just rules.
For example, for short trips, people can walk or ride a bike. For longer trips, they can use buses or the subway more often.
If the new options are easy, people will follow them. Then pollution can go down. If it feels too hard, people will complain and give up.
我觉得需要改，但不一定要“剧烈改变”。
大多数人每天都离不开出行，要上班，也要处理家里的事情。所以得先给可行的替代方案，而不是只喊口号。
比如短距离能走路就走路，或者骑车；远一点就更常用公交和地铁。
如果替代方案够方便，大家就愿意跟着做，污染也会降；但如果太难执行，人就只会抱怨，最后坚持不下去。

- How are the transportation systems in urban areas and rural areas different?
> Urban transport is usually more convenient. Rural transport is often more limited.
In cities, people live close together, so public transport works well. There are more bus lines, and they come more often. Many cities also have subways, so it’s easy to travel without a car.
In rural areas, people live farther apart. It’s hard to run many bus routes, and buses may come only a few times a day. So people often rely on their own vehicles.
For example, in cities, people can use the subway and shared bikes. In the countryside, many people use cars or motorcycles to get around.
So the big difference is choice. Cities offer more options, while rural areas depend more on personal transport.
城市交通一般更方便；农村交通通常更有限。
城市里人住得密，所以公共交通更好做。公交线路多，班次也更密。很多城市还有地铁，不开车也能出行。
农村地区人住得分散，距离也更远。公交线路不好铺，而且车可能一天就几趟，所以大家更依赖自己的交通工具。
比如城市里可以坐地铁、骑共享单车；但在乡下，很多人更常用私家车或摩托车出行。
所以差别核心就是“选择”。城市选择多，农村更靠个人交通。

- Why do more people own and drive private cars now?
> I think more people own and drive private cars mainly because it’s more convenient. Lifestyle has changed too.
A car gives you more flexibility, and it can save time, especially for commuting. It’s also more comfortable, and you don’t have to deal with bad weather as much.
Cars are also more affordable now for many families. Cities have expanded as well, so people often live farther from work.
For example, it’s easier to take your family out on weekends if you have a car. And on rainy days, driving feels much less hassle.
我觉得现在私家车变多，主要还是因为更方便，而且生活方式也变了。
有车出行更灵活，通勤也更省时间。舒适度也更高，遇到天气不好时尤其明显。
另外很多家庭收入提高了，买车也更容易了。城市变大以后，很多人住得离公司更远，更需要车。
比如周末带家人出去玩，有车会方便很多。下雨天通勤开车也更省事。

- What do you think of the future of electric cars?
> I’m quite positive about the future of electric cars. I think they will become more common, but it won’t happen overnight.
They have clear advantages. They’re quieter, and the running cost can be lower. But there are still limits. Charging is not equally convenient everywhere, and people worry about battery life and resale value.
So in big cities, electric cars will likely grow faster. They fit daily commuting well. In rural areas or for long trips, petrol cars may still stay for a while.
Overall, the trend is clear. Electric cars will take a bigger share. Better charging networks and better batteries will speed it up.
我对电动车的未来总体是看好的，我觉得会越来越普及，但不会一下子就完全替代油车。
它的优势很明显：更安静，用车成本也可能更低。但限制也还在，比如充电并不是哪里都方便，很多人也会担心电池寿命和二手保值。
所以大城市里电动车可能发展更快，因为很适合日常通勤。偏远地区或者经常跑长途的人，短期内可能还是离不开油车。
总的来说趋势很清楚：电动车占比会持续上升。充电网络和电池技术越成熟，推进就越快。

### 不享受的音乐活动
- Describe an event you attended in which you didn’t enjoy the music played.
  You should say:
  What it was?
  Who you went with?
  Why you decided to go there?
  And explain why you didn’t enjoy it?
> Well, let me tell you about a music event that was, to put it mildly, quite a letdown for me. It was a classical music concert I attended a few years ago, hoping for an evening of sublime melodies and masterful performances. However, the reality was starkly different. From the very beginning, the orchestra seemed out of sync, and the lead violinist made several noticeable mistakes. There were moments of hesitant playing and even some off-key notes, which was particularly jarring for a classical performance. Despite the growing discomfort and disappointment among the audience, I, along with most others, stayed until the very end. I kept hoping it would improve, or perhaps that the next piece would redeem the evening, but unfortunately, it never really did. I left the concert feeling profoundly disappointed. I mean, I appreciate the effort, but the performance quality was simply not up to standard. It was a wasted evening and definitely not the uplifting experience I had anticipated from a classical music event.
> 好吧,让我告诉你一个音乐活动,说得委婉些,对我来说是相当失望的。那是几年前我参加的一个古典音乐会,我希望有一个美妙的旋律和精湛的表演的夜晚。然而,现实却完全不同。从一开始,管弦乐队似乎就不协调,首席小提琴手犯了几个明显的错误。有犹豫的演奏,甚至一些走调的音符,这是特别不和谐的古典表演的时刻。尽管观众越来越不舒服和失望,我和大多数人一样,一直呆到最后。我一直希望它会有所改善,或者下一首曲子会弥补这个夜晚,但不幸的是,它从来没有真正做到。音乐会结束后,我感到非常失望。我是说,我很欣赏你的努力,但表演质量根本达不到标准。这是一个浪费的夜晚,绝对不是我在古典音乐活动中所期待的令人振奋的体验。

- What kind of music events do people like today?
> People today often like music events that feel lively and interactive. They don’t only go to hear songs. They go for the atmosphere.
One reason is that people want to relax and hang out at the same time. Also, short videos are everywhere now, so people like events that look good on camera.
For example, concerts and music festivals are very popular. Everyone sings along and the lights look amazing. Livehouse shows are popular too, because you’re closer to the singer and it feels more personal.
So these events are more than just music. They’re a full experience, and that’s why people prefer going in person.
我觉得现在大家更喜欢那种热闹、能互动的音乐活动。大家不只是去听歌，更是去感受现场氛围。
一个原因是大家想放松一下，同时也想跟朋友一起玩。再加上短视频太普遍了，很多人会更喜欢那种拍出来好看、发出去也有内容的现场。
比如演唱会和音乐节很受欢迎，大家一起跟唱，灯光也很震撼。还有 livehouse 也很火，因为离歌手更近，互动更直接。
所以这些活动不只是音乐而已，而是一种完整体验。这就是很多人更愿意去现场的原因。

- Do you think children should receive some musical education?
> Yes, I think children should receive some musical education. It doesn’t have to be super serious.
For example, they can learn basic rhythm and simple music theory. They can also join group activities like choir or percussion, because it feels fun and social.
Music training can improve focus and patience. It also helps kids express emotions in a healthy way. And group music teaches teamwork, because everyone has to follow the same beat.
So I don’t think every child needs to master an instrument. The goal is to let them enjoy music and make it part of life.
我觉得应该让孩子接受一些音乐教育，但别搞得太功利，先让孩子接触并且喜欢上更重要。
比如学一点基础乐理和节奏训练就很够用了。也可以参加合唱或者打击乐这种集体活动，因为更有趣，也更有参与感。
音乐训练能提升专注和耐心，也能帮孩子用更健康的方式表达情绪。集体音乐还会让孩子更会合作，因为大家要跟同一个节奏走。
所以我不觉得每个孩子都要把乐器练到很专业。让音乐变成一种日常习惯，其实就已经很不错了。

- What are the differences between old and young people’s music preferences?
> I think the differences are pretty clear. Older people often prefer familiar songs and strong melodies. Younger people are usually more open to new styles.
Many older listeners care a lot about lyrics and meaning. They like songs that bring back memories, so classic songs feel safe and comfortable. Young people often chase new trends and fast beats. They’re more willing to try different genres.
But it’s not always about age. If we judge only by age, it can be unfair. Some older people love electronic music, and some young people love old classics.
So age does influence music taste, but personal experience matters more. In the end, people just listen to what feels good to them.
我觉得差别挺明显的，主要在“熟悉感”和“节奏偏好”。
年长的人往往更看重旋律和歌词，也更喜欢熟悉的老歌，因为会带回忆，听起来更踏实、更舒服。年轻人通常更爱追新，节奏也更快一点，更愿意去尝试不同风格。
但如果只按年龄一刀切，也不准确。也有老人很爱电音，也有年轻人特别爱经典老歌。
所以年龄确实会影响音乐偏好，但个人经历更关键。最后大家还是听让自己舒服、听着顺的音乐。

- What kind of music events are there in your country?
> In my country, there are quite a few music events. The most common ones are large live shows.
Concerts are very popular, especially for big singers on tour. Music festivals are popular too, and they often have multiple stages and different genres.
Big cities usually have more options. The venues are also more professional. These days, events focus more on the whole experience, like stage visuals and audience interaction.
Overall, people have more choices than before. It’s easier to find something you enjoy. And more people are willing to pay for that live atmosphere.
在我国家，音乐活动其实挺多的，但最主流的还是那种大型现场。
比如大型演唱会很常见，很多歌手会做巡演。还有户外音乐节也很火，一般是多舞台、多风格，大家可以自由挑自己喜欢的。
一线城市的选择会更多，场馆也更专业。这几年活动也更重“体验感”，比如舞美灯光和互动环节都会做得更强。
总体来说，大家能选的更多了，也更容易找到合自己口味的活动。很多人也愿意为了现场氛围花这笔钱。

- Why do many people like listening to music while doing sports?
> Many people like listening to music while doing sports because it helps with rhythm. It makes the workout feel easier to keep going.
That said, it doesn’t fit every sport. For something like yoga, people may prefer quiet. They need to focus on breathing and movement.
For example, when you run, a strong beat helps you keep your pace. In the gym, music can pump you up during strength training.
So music can boost mood and focus. It makes exercise feel more enjoyable. And that’s why people are more likely to stick with it.
我觉得很多人运动时爱听音乐，主要是因为音乐能带节奏，让人更容易坚持下去。
当然也不是所有运动都适合听歌，比如瑜伽这种需要专注呼吸和动作的，可能安静一点更舒服。
比如跑步时听节奏强的歌，会更容易稳住配速。健身做力量训练时，音乐也能把人“顶起来”，更有劲。
所以音乐能提升情绪和专注，让运动体验更爽，也更容易把运动变成习惯。

- What are the differences between listening to music at home and at a live concert?
> To me, the main difference is the overall experience. A live concert feels more immersive, while listening at home feels more controlled and comfortable.
At a concert, the sound, the lights, and the crowd interaction create a strong atmosphere. It’s easier to get emotional and feel connected. At home, you can choose any song, pause anytime, and keep it quiet. It feels private and relaxing.
If you only listen at home, you miss that shared energy. You also miss that “wow” moment that stays with you.
So I think they fit different needs. Go to a concert for the big experience. Listen at home when you just want to relax.
我觉得核心差别就是整体体验。现场更沉浸，在家更可控、更舒服。
演唱会现场有音响、灯光，还有人群的互动，所以氛围很强，情绪也更容易被带动。在家听歌就更自在，你想听什么就听什么，想暂停就暂停，音量也能开得很小，会更私密、更放松。
如果你只在家听，其实会少一种共同氛围，也少那种“被震撼一下”的感觉，所以记忆点没那么强。
所以两种方式满足的需求不一样：想要强烈体验就去现场；想要自在放松就在家听。

### 朋友学的技能
- Describe one of your friends who learned something without a teacher.
  You should say:
  Who he/she is?
  What he/she learned?
  Why he/she learned this?
  And explain whether it would be easier to learn from a teacher?
> Well, I'd like to talk about one of my university roommates, Noble, who's not just a friend but also someone I deeply admire for his unique hobbies and dedication. He's always been the kind of person who dives deep into his interests, and that's exactly what he did with this particular skill. The skill he picked up is amateur radio communication, often known as 'ham radio'. It's essentially about using various radio frequency bands to communicate globally, which sounds quite technical, but Noble made it fascinating. He learned it from an older, experienced ham radio operator he met through an online forum, not in a formal classroom setting. The core story behind his learning journey is quite remarkable. He spent months meticulously building his own Yagi antenna from scratch, which is a directional antenna. Then, he managed to make contact with a Japanese friend through a repeater on the International Space Station. Imagine the thrill of that! It wasn't just about talking; it was about overcoming technical challenges and connecting across vast distances using self-made equipment. This skill has had a profound impact on him. It not only honed his technical problem-solving abilities but also broadened his perspective on global communication and cultural exchange. He's become more patient, detail-oriented, and has even inspired others, including myself, to explore unconventional hobbies. It's truly shaped who he is today, making him a more well-rounded and interesting individual.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我的大学室友之一Noble,他不仅是我的朋友,而且也是我深深钦佩的人,因为他独特的爱好和奉献精神。他一直是那种深入研究自己兴趣的人,而这正是他运用这种特殊技能所做的。他学到的技能是业余无线电通信,通常被称为“业余无线电”。它本质上是关于使用各种无线电频段在全球范围内进行通信,这听起来很技术,但Noble让它变得迷人。他从一位年长、经验丰富的业余无线电操作员那里学到了这一点,他是通过在线论坛而不是在正式的课堂环境中认识的。他的学习之旅背后的核心故事相当非凡。他花了几个月的时间从头开始精心建造自己的八木天线,这是一种定向天线。然后,他设法通过国际空间站上的转发器与一位日本朋友取得了联系。想象一下那有多刺激!这不仅仅是谈论;这是关于克服技术挑战并使用自制设备进行远距离连接。这项技能对他影响深远。这不仅磨练了他解决技术问题的能力,也拓宽了他对全球沟通和文化交流的视野。他变得更加有耐心、注重细节,甚至激励包括我自己在内的其他人去探索非常规的爱好。这确实塑造了今天的他,使他成为一个更加全面、有趣的人。

- Is it necessary to keep learning after graduating from school?
> Yes, I think it’s necessary. Graduating from school doesn’t mean you’re done learning.
Work changes really fast these days. New tools and new ways of doing things come out all the time. If you stop learning, it’s easy to fall behind.
And it’s not only about work. Life skills matter too. Things like managing money, staying healthy, or communicating better can make your daily life easier.
So I’d say lifelong learning is important. You don’t have to go back to school. You can just learn a little bit regularly.
我觉得很有必要。毕业并不代表“学习结束”了。
现在工作变化很快，新工具、新方法一直在出现。如果你完全不学，很容易就跟不上。
而且学习也不只是为了工作。很多生活技能也需要学，比如理财、健康管理、沟通表达，这些会让日子过得更顺。
所以我觉得毕业后持续学习很重要。你不一定要回学校，平时稳定地学一点就可以了。

- Should teachers make learning in their classes fun?
> Yes, I think teachers should make classes fun to a certain degree. When lessons are enjoyable, students pay more attention. They also feel less stressed.
That said, “fun” shouldn’t mean just playing games all the time. A class still needs clear goals. It also needs a good pace.
If teachers only chase fun, the content can become too shallow. Students may remember the jokes, but they forget the key points. That’s a waste of time.
So the best approach is “fun and useful.” Keep students engaged, and make sure they actually learn something.
我觉得老师应该让课堂在一定程度上更有趣。课好玩一点，学生更容易专注，也没那么紧张。
但我也想说，“有趣”不等于一直做游戏。课堂还是要有目标，也要有节奏。
如果老师只追求好玩，内容就可能变浅。学生可能只记得老师很逗，但知识点没留下来，那就很亏。
所以更好的做法是“有趣且有效”。让学生愿意学，同时也真的学到东西。

- Do you think there are too many subjects for students to learn?
> Yes, in many cases. Students have to learn too many subjects, especially in middle and high school.
If schools keep adding subjects, students’ time gets split up. They can’t go deep in any one subject, so learning becomes shallow.
I’m not saying we should drop the basics. But schools can make more subjects optional and cut repeated homework. That helps students focus on what matters.
In the end, fewer subjects with better learning can work. Students feel less stressed, and they understand things more clearly.
我觉得很多情况下确实有点多，尤其是中学阶段。
如果学校一直加科目，学生的时间就会被切碎，每门都学不深，学习就容易变浅。
我也不是说基础科目要砍掉，但其他科目可以更灵活一点，比如更多选修、模块化。作业也可以少一些重复，让学生把精力放在真正重要的内容上。
总的来说，科目少一点但学得更扎实会更合理。学生压力更低，理解也会更清楚。

- Is it better to focus on a few subjects or to learn many subjects?
> I’d say it’s better to focus on a few subjects, especially when you’re trying to build real skills. If you spread yourself too thin, you only touch the surface.
For example, if someone wants to go into engineering or coding, it helps to go deep in math, logic, and English. These subjects support almost everything else.
That said, learning many subjects also has value. It can help you find what you actually like, and it makes you more well-rounded.
So I think the best plan is balance. Learn a bit broadly at first, then narrow down later. You end up with both direction and strength.
我更偏向少而精，尤其是你想真正把能力练出来的时候。科目太多会摊薄精力，容易每门都只学个皮毛。
比如你想走理工或者编程方向，那数学、逻辑和英语就应该先学深一点，因为这些是很多能力的底层支撑。
但我也承认，多学一些科目也有意义。它能帮你更快发现自己喜欢什么，也能让你跟不同领域的人更好沟通。
所以我觉得最理想的是平衡：前期学得广一点，后期再收得窄一点。这样既不容易迷茫，也更容易形成核心竞争力。

- Do you think enterprises should provide training for their employees?
> Yes, I think enterprises should provide training. It’s a win-win.
For example, onboarding training helps new staff get up to speed faster. Training on new tools or systems also matters. It reduces mistakes and improves efficiency.
In the long run, better skills mean better results for the company. It also helps employees feel supported, so they’re more likely to stay.
So training doesn’t have to be fancy or expensive. Keep it practical, and do it regularly.
我觉得企业应该给员工提供培训，这其实是双赢。
比如新员工的入职培训，能让他们更快上手。再比如公司引入新工具、新系统的时候，配套培训能减少错误，提高效率。
长期来看，员工能力上去了，公司产出更稳定。员工也会觉得公司在支持自己，就更愿意留下来，流失率也会更低。
所以培训不一定要搞得很花哨、很烧钱。实用一点、持续一点就够了。

- Do you think it is good for older adults to continue learning?
> Yes, I think it’s really good for older adults to keep learning. It keeps their mind active, and it gives them a sense of progress.
It’s also very practical. Many daily tasks are digital now, like using a smartphone, shopping online, or booking a doctor’s appointment. If they learn these skills, life becomes much easier.
In the long run, learning helps them stay independent. It also boosts confidence, because they don’t have to rely on others for everything. And they can keep up in conversations with family and friends.
So I’d say it’s worth it. They don’t need to learn anything too hard. Just pick something useful and take it step by step.
我觉得这很好，老年人继续学习非常值得。
一方面，学习能让大脑保持活跃，不至于越老越“退”。另一方面也很实用，现在很多事情都数字化了，比如用智能手机、网购、线上挂号。如果学会这些，生活会方便很多。
长期来看，继续学习会让他们更独立、更有自信，不用什么都依赖别人。跟家人朋友聊天也不容易脱节。
所以我觉得很值得。他们不需要学很难的东西，选自己用得上的，慢慢来就行。

### 机智解决问题的人
- Describe a person who solved a problem in a smart way.
  You should say:
  Who this person is?
  What the problem was?
  How he/she solved it?
  And explain why you think he/she did it in a smart way?
> Well, I'd like to talk about my friend, Alex, who is an incredibly resourceful person. He's genuinely one of the most creative and out-of-the-box thinkers I know, always approaching challenges with a fresh perspective. A few months ago, I was really struggling with a complex data analysis project at work. I had spent days trying to figure out how to streamline the process, but everything I tried seemed to hit a dead end. I was feeling quite overwhelmed and frustrated, to be honest. That's when Alex stepped in. He wasn't even in my department, but he overheard me venting about it during a coffee break. He offered to take a look, and I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking it was too specialized for him. But he insisted, saying he loved a good puzzle. What he did was truly brilliant. Instead of focusing on the existing software, he suggested a completely different approach using a combination of open-source tools and a custom script he wrote on the spot. It was something I hadn't even considered. His solution not only automated a significant portion of the work, saving me countless hours, but also provided more accurate results than my initial method. I was absolutely blown away by his ingenuity. His ability to connect seemingly unrelated concepts and devise such an elegant solution was incredibly inspiring. It really taught me to look beyond conventional methods and embrace creative problem-solving.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我的朋友亚历克斯,他是一个非常足智多谋的人。他确实是我认识的最有创造力、最跳出框框的思想家之一,总是以新的视角应对挑战。几个月前,我在工作中为一个复杂的数据分析项目而苦苦挣扎。我花了几天时间试图弄清楚如何简化流程,但我尝试的一切似乎都陷入了死胡同。说实话,我感到非常不知所措和沮丧。就在那时,亚历克斯介入了。他甚至不在我的部门,但他无意中听到我在喝咖啡休息时发泄这件事。他主动提出要看看,我一开始有点怀疑,认为这对他来说太专业了。但他坚持说,他喜欢好的拼图。他所做的确实非常出色。他没有专注于现有的软件,而是建议了一种完全不同的方法,使用开源工具和他当场编写的自定义脚本的组合。这是我甚至没有考虑过的事情。他的解决方案不仅自动化了很大一部分工作,为我节省了无数时间,而且还提供了比我最初的方法更准确的结果。我完全被他的聪明才智所震撼。他将看似不相关的概念联系起来并设计出如此优雅的解决方案的能力令人难以置信地鼓舞人心。它确实教会了我超越传统方法并拥抱创造性的解决问题。

### 对家庭重要的东西
- Describe something important that has been kept in your family for a long time.
  You should say:
  What it is?
  When your family had it?
  How your family got it?
  And explain why it is important to your family?
> Well, an important item that has been kept in my family for a long time is actually my grandfather's third-class merit medal. It's something we all cherish deeply. This medal is quite special, you know, not just because of its age, but also due to the intricate patterns engraved on it. It depicts a soldier standing firm, with a star above, symbolizing honor and bravery. The story behind this medal is truly inspiring. My grandfather, who served as a military doctor, earned it for his selfless dedication in saving lives during a border defense battle. He worked tirelessly, often under extremely dangerous conditions, to tend to the wounded. For me, this medal holds immense emotional value. It constantly reminds me of his courage and resilience, and it motivates me to strive for excellence in my own life, whatever challenges I may face. It's a symbol of our family's heritage and a source of great pride.
> 嗯,家里长期保存的一件重要物品实际上就是我祖父的三等功奖章。这是我们都深深珍惜的东西。你知道,这枚奖章相当特别,不仅是因为它的年代,还因为上面雕刻着错综复杂的图案。它描绘了一名士兵站稳脚跟,上面有一颗星星,象征着荣誉和勇敢。这枚奖牌背后的故事确实令人鼓舞。我的祖父曾担任军医,他因在边防战斗中无私奉献拯救生命而赢得这一荣誉。他不知疲倦地工作,通常是在极其危险的条件下,照顾伤员。对我来说,这枚奖牌具有巨大的情感价值。它不断提醒我他的勇气和韧性,它激励我在自己的生活中追求卓越,无论我面临什么挑战。它是我们家族遗产的象征,也是我们巨大自豪的源泉。

- What things do families keep for a long time?
> Usually, families keep things for a long time because they mean something. It’s not always about money.
A big one is memory stuff. For example, old photos are hard to throw away. They remind people of family members and old times.
Another type is “still useful” stuff. For example, some families keep old furniture because it still works. They also feel it’s a waste to replace it.
Over time, these things become part of the home. They carry stories. But honestly, they can also pile up, and that makes cleaning harder.
一般来说，家里能留很久的东西，大多不是因为贵，而是因为“有意义”，丢不下。
最常见的一类是纪念类。比如老照片真的很难扔，因为它会让人想到家里人和以前的日子。
另一类就是“还能用”的东西。比如一些老家具虽然旧，但还好用，换掉反而觉得浪费。
时间久了，这些东西就变成家的一部分了，像是带着故事。但说实话，也可能越堆越多，最后清理起来更难。

- What’s the difference between things valued by people in the past and today?
> Honestly, people in the past cared more about survival and stability. They wanted things that could “hold up” in real life.
Life was less certain, so they valued saving and durability. If something could last for years, that was a big deal.
Today, many people still care about money. But they care more about comfort and experience too. They ask, “Does this make my life easier?” and “Do I actually enjoy it?”
For example, in the past people might keep one appliance for ten years. Now some people pay for services like delivery because it saves time.
So the values feel more personal today. That’s nice, but it also makes people compare more and overthink.
说实话，过去的人更在意“能不能活得稳、扛不扛得住”。他们更想要那种能在现实里顶得住的东西。
因为日子不确定感更强，所以大家更重视存钱和耐用。一个东西能用很多年，在当时就很值。
现在的人当然也在乎钱，但也更在乎舒服和体验。大家会问：“这能不能让生活更省事？”“我到底喜不喜欢？”
比如以前一个家电用十年很正常；现在有些人愿意花钱买配送服务，因为省时间。
所以现在的价值标准更个人化了。这挺爽的，但也更容易让人比较、纠结。

- What kinds of things are kept in museums?
> Museums usually keep things that tell a story about the past. They don’t have to be expensive, but they need to be meaningful.
A lot of museums keep historical objects. These can be old tools, pottery, paintings, or traditional clothes.
Museums also keep records. They may collect old photos, letters, or documents, because these show how people lived and what happened in history.
For example, you might see ancient objects like pottery or calligraphy. You can also see things like war-time letters or old photos. They help people understand the past in a clearer way.
博物馆一般收藏的是能讲出“过去故事”的东西，不一定多贵，但一定得有意义。
很多博物馆会收藏历史物件，比如旧工具、陶器、画作，或者传统服饰。
它们也会收藏一些记录类的东西，比如老照片、信件、文件，因为这些能反映当时的人怎么生活、发生过什么。
比如你可能会看到古代的陶器或书法作品，也可能看到战争时期的信件或老照片。这些东西能让人更清楚地理解过去。

- What’s the influence of technology on museums?
> Technology has changed museums a lot. It helps people understand exhibitions more easily. It also makes museums more interesting.
Many museums now use simple tools like apps and audio guides. Visitors can scan a code and listen to an explanation. Some museums also use AR or VR. It can show how something looked in the past.
Technology also makes museums easier to visit from far away. Museums can put exhibitions online. People can watch videos or take an online tour at home.
But there is a small downside. Some visitors focus too much on taking photos. They don’t spend enough time really looking at the objects.
科技对博物馆的影响很大。它能帮助人更容易看懂展览，也能让博物馆变得更有意思。
现在很多博物馆都会用一些简单工具，比如App和语音导览。你扫个码就能听讲解。有些博物馆还会用AR或VR，让你看到东西在过去可能是什么样。
科技也让“远距离参观”更容易。博物馆可以把展览放到网上，人们在家也能看视频或做线上参观。
但也有一个小问题。有些人太专注拍照，反而没花足够时间认真看展品。

- What are the benefits of technology for learning history?
> It’s really helpful. Technology makes learning history more visual and easier to get into.
Because of that, people understand faster and remember better. It also makes history feel less dry, so students are more interested.
Another big benefit is access. You can look up sources anytime, and you can learn in different formats. Videos and interactive tools make a big difference.
For example, a documentary or a short video can give you a clear picture quickly. And a timeline or an interactive map can help you connect events with time and place.
我觉得好处很明显，科技让学历史更直观，也更容易入门。
因此理解会更快、记得更牢。历史也没那么枯燥，兴趣更容易被带起来。
另外就是获取资料更方便，随时都能查，而且学习形式更多样。视频和一些互动工具会特别有用。
比如看纪录片或短视频，能很快建立画面感。再比如用时间线或互动地图，把事件的时间顺序和地点串起来，会更清楚。

- Why do people visit museums?
> I think people visit museums for a real cultural experience. It’s not just about looking at objects.
For example, seeing real artifacts or famous paintings feels different. The details are more powerful in person. Some parents also take their kids there, because it’s a fun way to learn.
Museums also create a special atmosphere. They usually tell a story, so history feels clearer. And for many people, it’s a calm way to spend a weekend.
In the end, museums help people learn and reflect. They also give people a break from busy life, and that’s why they’re still popular.
我觉得大家去博物馆，主要是为了获得一种真实的文化体验，不只是“看看展品”这么简单。
比如看真文物或者名画，现场的细节冲击感更强。还有很多家长会带孩子去，因为这是一个边玩边学的方式。
另外博物馆本身也有氛围，它会把内容串成一条故事线，所以历史更好理解。对很多人来说，这也是一种很安静的放松方式，周末去逛一圈挺舒服的。
总的来说，博物馆既能让人增长见识，也能给人一种情绪上的满足。它还能让人更珍惜自己本土的文化，所以一直都有人去。

### APP应用
- Describe a program or app on your computer or phone.
  You should say:
  What it is?
  How often you use it?
  When/how you use it?
  When/how you found it?
  And explain how you feel about it?
> Well, the app I'd like to talk about today is called Xiaohongshu, which translates to 'Little Red Book' in English. It's a hugely popular social media and e-commerce platform in China, primarily known for user-generated content related to lifestyle, fashion, beauty, and travel. Essentially, its main function is to allow users to share their daily lives through short videos and photo posts, often accompanied by detailed reviews and recommendations. You can find everything from makeup tutorials and travel guides to cooking recipes and home decor inspiration there. What makes it particularly special for me is how it helped me solve a real-life problem recently. I was struggling to find effective ways to organize my small apartment, and I stumbled upon some incredibly creative and practical storage solutions shared by other users on Xiaohongshu. I mean, these weren't just generic tips; they were specific product recommendations and DIY hacks that perfectly fit my space and budget. Using the app gave me a strong sense of inspiration and empowerment. It wasn't just about finding solutions; it was about connecting with a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about sharing and discovering new ideas. It's truly a platform that sparks creativity and helps you navigate various aspects of modern living.
> 今天我要讲的应用程序叫小红书,英文翻译过来就是小红书。它是中国一个非常受欢迎的社交媒体和电子商务平台,主要以与生活方式,时尚,美容和旅游相关的用户生成内容而闻名。本质上,它的主要功能是允许用户通过短视频和照片帖子分享他们的日常生活,通常还附有详细的评论和建议。您可以在那里找到从化妆教程和旅行指南到烹饪食谱和家居装饰灵感的一切。它对我来说特别的是它如何帮助我解决了最近现实生活中的一个问题。我正在努力寻找有效的方法来整理我的小公寓,偶然发现了一些令人难以置信的创意和实用的存储解决方案,这些解决方案由小红书上的其他用户分享。我的意思是,这些不仅仅是一般的技巧;它们是完全适合我的空间和预算的具体产品推荐和DIY技巧。使用该应用程序给了我强烈的灵感和力量感。这不仅仅是寻找解决方案;而是与志同道合的人组成的社区建立联系,他们热衷于分享和发现新想法。它确实是一个激发创造力并帮助您驾驭现代生活各个方面的平台。

- What are the differences between old and young people when using apps?
> They use apps quite differently. Younger people usually use more apps, and they switch between them fast. 
Older people often keep things simple. They use fewer apps, and they prefer apps that are easy to understand. They may only use the main functions. They also worry more about making mistakes ，like paying by accident.
For example, a young person may explore settings and change things to fit their habits. An older person may stick to the same few apps for a long time. They may only open them when they really need them.
So the difference is mainly about needs and confidence. Younger people want speed and variety. Older people want clarity and safety.
我觉得年轻人和老年人用App差别挺明显的。年轻人一般装得多、切得快。
老年人通常更偏“用得简单”。他们用的App数量更少，更喜欢那种一看就懂的。很多时候他们只用最核心的功能，而且更担心出错，比如不小心花钱。
举个例子，年轻人可能会去研究设置，把界面和提醒改成自己习惯的样子；老年人往往长期只用固定几个App，需要的时候才打开。
 所以差异不只是年龄本身，更是需求、熟练度和安全感不一样。

- Why do some people not like using apps?
> Some people don’t like using apps because they find them annoying. There are too many steps. You need to sign up, confirm codes, and allow permissions. It feels like a lot of work.
Another big reason is safety. Some people worry about privacy. They don’t want apps to track them. They also worry about paying by accident. If they don’t fully trust an app, they would rather not use it.
Also, apps change all the time. Updates can move buttons around. Older users can feel lost. Even younger people can get tired of learning new layouts.
So I think it’s not that they hate technology. They just want something simple and under control.
有些人不喜欢用App，最常见的原因就是觉得麻烦、而且没有安全感。很多App步骤特别多，要注册、输验证码、还要点一堆权限弹窗，用起来就很累。
另一个原因是安全问题。有些人担心隐私，不想被追踪；也有人怕误操作，比如不小心扣费。如果对一个App不够信任，他们宁愿不用。
还有就是App变化太快，经常更新，按钮位置一变就找不到。年纪大的人更容易迷路，年轻人也可能觉得烦。
所以我觉得他们不是讨厌科技，只是更想要简单、可控的方式。

- What apps are popular inyour country? Why?
> In China, the most popular apps are usually the ones people “can’t avoid”. They solve daily needs, and they also keep people entertained.
WeChat is a big one. People use it to talk to friends and family. Many people also use it to pay, so it becomes part of daily life.
Another popular app is Douyin. It’s not just fun. The recommendations are strong, so you keep watching the next video. You don’t even notice the time.
So the reason is simple. These apps are useful, and they are addictive in a light way. That’s why almost everyone has them.
在中国，最火的App通常就是那种你“绕不开”的。它们解决日常刚需，同时也很能让人放松和上头。
微信就是典型。大家用它联系朋友家人，也经常用它付款，所以它直接变成生活的一部分。
另一个很火的是抖音。它不只是好玩，更关键是推荐太强了，一个接一个，你就会一直看，时间不知不觉就过去了。
所以原因很简单：有用 + 容易沉迷一点点。大家自然都装着，而且天天用。

- Should parents limit their children’s use of computer programs and computer games? Why and how?
> Yes, I think parents should limit it, but not ban it. Kids need fun, and some programs are useful. But without rules, it can get out of control.
Games can help children relax, and some software can teach real skills. The problem is that many kids don’t know when to stop.
So parents should set clear boundaries. For example, on weekdays it can be one hour a day. Parents should also check what the child plays or uses, not only the time.
If the limits are clear, sleep and study stay stable. If there are no limits, the child can get addicted and fall into a messy routine.
我觉得家长应该限制，但没必要完全禁止。孩子也需要娱乐，而且有些软件确实有用；但如果没规则，很容易失控。
游戏能让孩子放松，一些软件也能学到真技能。问题是很多孩子不知道什么时候该停。
所以家长要设清楚边界。比如平日一天一小时左右，同时也要看孩子玩什么、用什么，而不只是盯着时长。
规则清楚的话，睡眠和学习会更稳；但如果没限制，就可能上瘾，作息也会乱掉。

- Do you think young people are more and more reliant on these programs?
> Yes, I think young people rely on these programs more and more. They use them for many parts of daily life.
A lot of things are now on one screen. They study with apps, talk to friends online, and relax with videos or games. When something is that easy, people naturally use it more.
For example, many students use learning apps to do homework or review. In their free time, they may watch short videos or play games.
The good side is convenience. But the bad side is that it can hurt focus. If they use it too much, they may feel bored without it.
我觉得是的，年轻人确实越来越依赖这些程序了，因为它们已经进到生活的很多部分。
现在很多事情都集中在一块屏幕上：学习用App，社交也在线上，放松的时候就刷视频或玩游戏。越方便，就越容易用得更多。
比如很多学生会用学习软件写作业、复习；空闲时就刷短视频或者玩游戏。
好处当然是省事，但坏处是容易影响专注。如果用得太多，离开这些东西反而会觉得无聊、不习惯。

- What do you think about some countries banning children from using social media?
> I’m partly in favour of it, but I don’t think a total ban is always the best idea. The goal is to protect kids, and that part makes sense.
A ban can reduce risks, especially for younger children. It can lower the chance of addiction, and it can keep them away from harmful content.
But if you ban it completely, many kids will still find a way around it. They might use a friend’s account or lie about their age. Then it becomes harder for parents and schools to guide them.
So I prefer a balanced approach. Set a minimum age and limit screen time. Teach kids how to use social media safely, too.
我有点支持，但我不太赞成完全“一刀切”地禁。出发点是保护孩子，这个我能理解。
禁令确实能减少风险，尤其对低龄孩子更友好。比如能降低沉迷的可能，也能让他们少接触一些不合适的内容。
但如果完全禁止，很多孩子还是会想办法绕过去，比如借朋友账号、谎报年龄。那反而更难监管，也更难引导。
所以我更喜欢折中方案：设定年龄门槛，再加使用时长限制。同时也要教孩子基本的网络素养，知道什么能信、什么该避开。

### 微笑的场合
- Describe an occasion when many people were smiling.
  You should say:
  When it happened?
  Who you were with?
  What happened?
  And explain why most people were smiling.
> Well, let me tell you about a time when everyone was beaming with joy, and that was at my friend Sarah's 24th birthday party. It took place a couple of months ago at a cozy, rustic-themed restaurant downtown, which she absolutely adores. The atmosphere was already buzzing with excitement even before the main event. The highlight of the evening, and the reason for all the smiles, was a surprise gift we had all secretly chipped in for. Sarah had always dreamed of traveling to Japan, so we got her a complete travel package, including flights and accommodation. When she unwrapped the gift and saw the tickets, her eyes widened, and a huge, genuine smile spread across her face. Everyone present, seeing her reaction, couldn't help but smile too, some even tearing up with happiness for her. The party continued with an incredibly joyful vibe. Her initial shock quickly turned into overwhelming excitement, and she spent the rest of the evening chatting animatedly about her upcoming trip. The energy was infectious, and it felt like everyone was celebrating not just her birthday, but also her dreams coming true. We all had a fantastic time, sharing stories and laughter late into the night. I remember feeling incredibly happy and uplifted that night. It was truly heartwarming to witness such pure joy and to be a part of making someone's dream a reality. Seeing so many people genuinely happy and smiling, all for a common reason, was a beautiful experience that definitely left a lasting impression on me.
> 好吧,让我告诉你一个每个人都兴高采烈的时刻,那是在我朋友莎拉的24岁生日派对上。事情发生在几个月前,在市中心一家舒适的乡村主题餐厅举行,她非常喜欢这家餐厅。甚至在主要活动开始之前,气氛就已经沸腾了。当晚的亮点,也是所有微笑的原因,是我们都秘密花钱买的一份惊喜礼物。莎拉一直梦想着去日本旅行,所以我们为她提供了完整的旅行套餐,包括机票和住宿。当她打开礼物的包装看到门票时,她睁大了眼睛,脸上绽放出巨大的、真诚的微笑。在场的每个人看到她的反应,也都忍不住笑了,有些人甚至为她高兴得热泪盈眶,聚会气氛非常欢乐。她最初的震惊很快变成了压倒性的兴奋,整个晚上她都在热情地谈论即将到来的旅行。这种能量具有感染力,感觉每个人不仅在庆祝她的生日,也在庆祝她的梦想成真。我们都度过了一段美好的时光,分享故事和笑声直到深夜。我记得那天晚上我感到非常高兴和振奋。目睹如此纯粹的喜悦并成为实现某人梦想的一部分,真是令人温馨。看到这么多人真诚地快乐和微笑,这一切都是出于一个共同的原因,是一次美好的经历,绝对给我留下了持久的印象。

### 喜欢画画的孩子
- Describe a child who loves drawing/painting.
  You should say:
  Who he/she is?
  How/when you knew him/her?
  How often he/she draws/paints?
  And explain why you think he/she loves drawing/painting?
> Well, I'd like to talk about a child I know who absolutely loves drawing, and that's my neighbor's kid, a lovely girl named Lily. She's incredibly imaginative and has a really vibrant personality, always full of energy and curiosity. I remember one particular instance when she drew a stunning picture of a fantastical forest, complete with talking animals and glowing flowers. It was for a local art competition, and to everyone's delight, especially hers, she actually won first prize! I think her passion for drawing stems from a very young age; she's always been fascinated by colors and shapes. Her parents told me she started doodling even before she could properly walk, and it just naturally evolved into a deep love for artistic expression. For her, drawing isn't just a hobby; it's a way to bring her inner world to life, and that's truly inspiring to witness.
> 嗯,我想谈谈我认识的一个非常喜欢画画的孩子,那是我邻居的孩子,一个可爱的女孩,名叫莉莉。她富有想象力,性格非常充满活力,总是充满活力和好奇心。我记得有一个特别的例子,当时她画了一幅令人惊叹的梦幻森林画,里面有会说话的动物和发光的花朵。这是为了参加当地的一场艺术比赛,令每个人,尤其是她的,她竟然获得了一等奖!我认为她对绘画的热情源于很小的时候;她总是对颜色和形状着迷。她的父母告诉我,她甚至在能正常行走之前就开始涂鸦,这自然而然地演变成对艺术表达的深深热爱。对她来说,绘画不仅仅是一种爱好;这是一种将她的内心世界带入生活的方式,这确实令人鼓舞。

### 常做计划的人
- Describe a person who makes plans a lot and is good at planning.
  You should say:
  Who he/she is?
  How you knew him/her?
  What plans he/she makes?
  And explain how you feel about this person?
> Well, the person I'd like to talk about is one of my university roommates, actually my best friend, named Noble. We lived together for four years during our undergraduate studies. He is, by nature, an incredibly organized and meticulous person. He always has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve and how to get there. The most impressive plan he ever made, and one that really stuck with me, was his comprehensive career development plan. This wasn't just a vague idea; it was a detailed roadmap he created during our final year at university, outlining his goals for the next five to ten years. I remember being absolutely amazed by his foresight and dedication. His plan covered everything from the specific skills he needed to acquire, to the companies he wanted to work for, and even the certifications he aimed to get. Witnessing his methodical approach truly inspired me to think more strategically about my own future, and I've tried to adopt some of his planning habits ever since.
> 嗯,我想谈论的人是我的一个大学室友,实际上是我最好的朋友,名叫莎拉。本科期间,我们一起生活了四年。她天生是一个非常有组织性和一丝不苟的人。她总是清楚自己想要实现什么以及如何实现目标。她制定过的最令人印象深刻的计划,也是真正让我着迷的计划,是她全面的职业发展计划。这不仅仅是一个模糊的想法;这是她在大学最后一年制定的一份详细的路线图,概述了她未来五到十年的目标。我记得她的远见和奉献精神让我感到非常惊讶。她的计划涵盖了一切,从她需要获得的具体技能到她想工作的公司,甚至她想要获得的认证。目睹她有条不紊的方法确实激励了我更有战略性地思考自己的未来,从那时起我就尝试采用她的一些规划习惯。

### 想拥有的科技产品
- Describe a piece of technology (not a phone) that you would like to own.
  You should say:
  What it is?
  How much it costs?
  How you knew it?
  And explain why you would like to own it?
> Well, if I had to pick a piece of technology I'd really like to own, it would definitely be a home NAS, or Network Attached Storage. I mean, it's something I've been considering for a while now. This isn't just any external hard drive; it's a dedicated device that connects to my home network, offering a centralized location for all my digital files. The main draw for me is its massive storage capacity, which can be expanded as needed, and the ability to access my data from anywhere with an internet connection. You know, in this digital age, we accumulate so many precious memories – photos, videos, important documents. My current setup involves multiple external drives, and honestly, it's a bit of a mess. A NAS would streamline this entirely, acting as a reliable backup system for all those irreplaceable moments, ensuring they're safe and sound. Ultimately, owning a NAS would bring me a profound sense of peace of mind. The thought of losing years of family photos or crucial work files is quite daunting, so having a robust, automated backup solution would alleviate that anxiety significantly. It's not just about storage; it's about safeguarding my digital life and feeling secure.
> 好吧,如果我必须选择一项我真正想拥有的技术,那肯定是家庭NAS或网络附加存储。我的意思是,这是我考虑了一段时间的事情。这不仅仅是任何外部硬盘驱动器;它是一个连接到我的家庭网络的专用设备,为我的所有数字文件提供集中位置。对我来说,主要吸引力是它巨大的存储容量,可以根据需要扩展,以及通过互联网连接从任何地方访问我的数据的能力。你知道,在这个数字时代,我们积累了很多宝贵的记忆--照片、视频、重要的文件。我当前的设置涉及多个外部驱动器,老实说,有点混乱。NAS将完全简化这一过程,充当所有不可替代时刻的可靠备份系统,确保它们的安全可靠。最终,拥有一台NAS会给我带来一种深刻的安心感。一想到丢失多年的家庭照片或重要工作文件就相当令人畏惧,因此拥有一个强大的自动化备份解决方案将显着缓解这种焦虑。这不仅仅是存储的问题;这还关系到保护我的数字生活和安全感。

### 外国的短期停留
- Describe a place in a foreign country you would like to stay or work for a short time. 
  You should say: 
  What place it is? 
  Where you got to know this place? 
  What you will do there?
  Why you will stay or work there just for a short time?
> Well, that's an interesting question. If I had the opportunity to choose a short-term job in a foreign country, I would definitely opt for a volunteer position. More specifically, I'm talking about volunteering at a major international sporting event, like the Olympics or a World Cup, which I think would be an absolutely incredible experience. My primary motivation for wanting to do this is to immerse myself in a different culture and gain a unique perspective on how such large-scale events are organized. You know, I actually had a taste of this kind of work when I volunteered at the Asian Winter Games a few years ago. My role then was to welcome international delegations at the airport, which was really rewarding. I anticipate that this kind of volunteer work would be incredibly fulfilling, not just because of the chance to contribute to a global event, but also because I'm confident I'd learn a tremendous amount of new things, from cross-cultural communication skills to problem-solving in a dynamic environment. It's the satisfaction of growth and connection that truly appeals to me.
> 嗯,这是一个有趣的问题。如果我有机会在国外选择一份短期工作,我一定会选择志愿者职位。更具体地说,我指的是在重大国际体育赛事中担任志愿者,例如奥运会或世界杯,我认为这绝对是一次令人难以置信的经历。我想要这样做的主要动机是让自己沉浸在不同的文化中,并对如何组织此类大型活动有独特的视角。要知道,几年前我在亚冬会做志愿者时,其实就尝到了这种工作的滋味。当时我的角色是在机场欢迎国际代表团,这确实很有回报。我预计这种志愿者工作将会非常有成就感,不仅是因为有机会为全球活动做出贡献,而且还因为我相信我会学到大量的新东西,从跨文化沟通技巧到在动态环境中解决问题。成长和联系的满足感真正吸引我。

### 给别人建议
- Describe a time when you gave advice to others. 
  You should say: 
  When it was? 
  To whom you gave the advice? 
  What the advice was? 
  And explain why you gave the advice?
> Well, I remember a particular time when a good friend of mine was really struggling with his academic path. He was feeling quite stuck, you know, at a crossroads with his studies. This happened last semester, actually, when we were both in our second year of university. He was facing a major decision about his specialization, which was causing him a lot of stress and uncertainty. I advised him to thoroughly research the job market and future career prospects related to different specializations. I suggested he look into what skills were in demand and how various fields were evolving, rather than just focusing on his immediate interests. I also encouraged him to talk to alumni who were already working in those areas. After taking my advice, he spent a good few weeks diving deep into research and networking. This really helped him gain a clearer perspective on his options. Ultimately, he chose a specialization that aligned well with future opportunities, and he's now much more confident and motivated in his studies. It was great to see him find his direction.
> 嗯,我记得有一个特殊的时刻,我的一个好朋友在他的学术道路上真的很挣扎。他感觉自己陷入了学业的十字路口。事实上,这发生在上学期,当时我们都在大学二年级。他面临着一个关于专业化的重大决定,这给他带来了很大的压力和不确定性。我建议他彻底研究与不同专业相关的就业市场和未来职业前景。我建议他研究需要哪些技能以及各个领域如何发展,而不是只关注他的眼前利益。我还鼓励他与已经在这些领域工作的校友交谈。在接受了我的建议后,他花了好几周的时间深入研究和网络。这确实帮助他对自己的选择有了更清晰的看法。最终,他选择了与未来机会相匹配的专业,现在他对学习更加自信和积极。很高兴看到他找到了自己的方向。

### 完美工作
- Describe a perfect job you would like to have in the future.
  You should say: 
  What it is? 
  How you knew it? 
  What you need to learn to get this job? 
  And explain why you think it is a perfect job for you?
> Well, the perfect job I'd absolutely love to have in the future is to be a satellite attitude and orbit control subsystem designer. This role primarily involves designing and optimizing satellite orbits, which is a highly specialized and technical field. What truly attracts me to this position is the incredible opportunity to contribute to major national projects. Imagine being part of something that pushes the boundaries of space exploration and technology! For me, this job isn't just about a career; it's about making a tangible contribution to my country's progress and scientific advancement.

### 禁用手机的场合

  You should say: 
  When it was? 
  Where it was? 
  Why you were not allowed to use your mobile phone? 
  And how you felt about it? 
> Well, the specific occasion I'm thinking of was a classical symphony concert I attended last year at the Grand Theater. It's a common rule at such venues that mobile phones must be switched off or put on silent mode, and absolutely no photography or videography is allowed during the performance. I remember during the intermission, I briefly took out my phone to check a message, and immediately, an usher politely reminded me to put it away. Then, as the concert resumed, the orchestra played a particularly breathtaking piece, and I had this strong urge to capture the moment, to take a quick photo or a short video to remember the stunning performance and the grand atmosphere. However, knowing the rules, I resisted the temptation. While I understood and respected the policy, I have to admit, I felt a little bit of regret that I couldn't preserve that beautiful memory with a picture. It was a truly unforgettable experience, and I wished I could have had a visual souvenir.
> 嗯,我想到的具体场合是我去年在大剧院参加的一场古典交响乐音乐会。此类场所的普遍规定是必须关闭手机或置于静音模式,演出期间绝对不允许拍照或摄像。我记得在中场休息期间,我短暂地拿出手机查看了一条信息,立即,一位引座员礼貌地提醒我把它收起来。然后,随着音乐会继续进行,管弦乐队演奏了一首特别令人惊叹的曲子,我有一种强烈的冲动,想要捕捉这一刻,拍一张快速的照片或一段短视频来记住这场令人惊叹的表演和盛大的气氛。然而,知道规则,我抵制住了诱惑。虽然我理解并尊重这项政策,但我不得不承认,我感到有点遗憾,我不能用一张照片来保存那段美好的记忆。这是一次真正难忘的经历,我希望我能有一个视觉纪念品。

> Well, I'd like to talk about my grandfather, who I am incredibly proud of. He served our country on the border as a military doctor, saving lives during wartime and earning a third-class merit medal for his bravery and dedication. I mean, he literally risked his life on the battlefield, working under constant shelling to treat injured soldiers. This experience, and his actions, made me admire him even more, and I truly look up to him for his selflessness and courage.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我的祖父,我为他感到非常自豪。他作为军医在边境服役,在战时拯救了生命,并因其勇敢和奉献精神荣获三等功奖章。我的意思是,他确实冒着生命危险在战场上,在不断的炮击下工作来治疗受伤的士兵。这段经历和他的行为让我更加钦佩他,我真正钦佩他的无私和勇气。
