# Speaking2026年1-4月题库
## Part1
### View

- Do you prefer views in urban areas or in rural areas?
> I definitely prefer views in rural areas. Natural landscapes like mountains and rivers give me a sense of peace and help me relax. Urban views can be impressive too, but they often feel crowded and repetitive to me.

- Do you like taking pictures of different views?
> Yes, I enjoy capturing beautiful views with my phone camera, especially when I travel. It’s a simple way to preserve memories and share moments with friends. I don’t spend too much time editing though—I prefer keeping them natural.

- Do you prefer views in your own country or in other countries?
> I appreciate both, but views in my own country feel more familiar and meaningful to me. Still, I find foreign landscapes incredibly fascinating because they offer new perspectives and cultural experiences.

- Do you usually look for a room with a good view when you travel?
> If possible, I try to choose a room with a nice view, especially if it overlooks natural scenery. It makes my stay more enjoyable and memorable. However, if it’s too expensive, I don’t mind skipping it to save money.

### Life stage
- How do people remember each stage of their lives?
> People often remember different stages through photographs, keepsakes, or significant milestones like graduations. Sharing stories with family and friends also helps keep memories alive. Personally, I sometimes reflect by looking back at old journals or social media posts.

- What did you often do with your friends in your childhood?
> As a child, I used to play outdoor games like hide-and-seek or football with my friends in our neighborhood. We also enjoyed riding bicycles and exploring nearby parks together. Those simple activities created some of my happiest memories.

- What do you think is the most important at the moment?
> Right now, I believe personal growth and maintaining a healthy work-life balance are most important. Focusing on my studies and well-being helps me stay motivated. Also, spending quality time with loved ones is something I truly value.

- Do you have any plans for the next five years?
> Yes, I hope to complete my studies and gain some professional experience in my field. I also plan to improve my language skills and travel to a few new countries. Overall, I want to keep learning and exploring different opportunities.

- Do you enjoy being the age you are now?
> Generally, yes—I appreciate the independence and opportunities that come with my current age. There are more responsibilities, of course, but I feel capable of shaping my own path. It’s a good balance between youth and maturity.

- At what age do you think people are the happiest?
> I don’t believe there’s one specific age—happiness can come at any stage. Childhood is often carefree, while adulthood brings freedom and achievements. Many say retirement allows more time for hobbies and family. It really depends on the person and their circumstances.


### Building
- Are there tall buildings near your home?
> Yes, there are several tall office buildings and apartment complexes in my neighborhood. They are mostly concentrated around the business district, which is about a ten-minute walk from my home. I often see their modern glass facades reflecting sunlight during the day.

- Do you take photos of buildings?
> Sometimes, especially when I travel. I like photographing unique or historically significant buildings, like temples or modern landmarks. In daily life, though, I rarely take pictures of ordinary buildings unless the lighting or angle looks particularly striking.

- Is there a building that you would like to visit?
> Yes, I’d love to visit the Eiffel Tower in Paris one day. It’s not only an iconic structure but also offers a breathtaking view of the city. Experiencing its history and design in person would be unforgettable.

- Do you want to live in a tall building?
> I’m not sure—it depends. Living on a higher floor could provide nice views and more natural light. However, I might worry about relying too much on elevators or feeling isolated. For now, I prefer mid-rise apartments for a balance.

### Childhood activities

- What are your favourite activities?
> Well, I’d say I really enjoy staying active and exploring new things. I often go hiking on weekends because it helps me relax in nature. Besides that, I like reading—especially non-fiction—and occasionally meeting friends for coffee or a meal.

- What were your favourite activities when you were a child?
> When I was younger, I was very energetic and loved playing outdoors. I remember spending hours riding my bicycle around the neighbourhood with friends. I also enjoyed drawing and building things with blocks or Lego.

- Did you prefer to do activities alone or with a group of people when you were a child?
> Actually, I mostly preferred being with other children. Group games like hide-and-seek were much more fun with friends. But sometimes, I also liked playing quietly by myself, especially when drawing or building something creative.

- Are there any difference between the activities you liked when you were a child and those you like now?
> Yes, there are some clear differences. As a child, my activities were mostly about play and imagination, whereas now I lean toward hobbies that help me unwind or learn something new. Also, I’m more interested in solo or small-group activities now, rather than large, noisy games.

### Travel/Scenery

- Do you prefer the mountains or the sea?
> That's a tough choice, but if I had to pick, I'd say the mountains. I find the fresh air and peaceful hiking trails incredibly refreshing. Though, I must admit, a day by the sea is also wonderful for its own sense of calm.

- Do you like to take scenery pictures?
>  Yes, I do, but I'm not a professional. I often take quick photos on my phone when a view really strikes me—like a stunning sunset or a unique landscape. It's more about capturing a personal memory than perfect photography.

- Do you look out the window at the scenery when travelling by bus or car?
> Absolutely, I almost always do. I find it relaxing to watch the world go by, especially on longer journeys through the countryside. It's a nice way to pass the time and sometimes spot interesting places.

- What are the most beautiful sights you have seen while traveling?
> The most beautiful sight I've ever seen while traveling is the aurora borealis over the Hulunbuir Grassland. The colors of the aurora were incredibly vibrant, painting the night sky with hues of red, green and purple. It was an absolutely breathtaking experience that left me feeling completely awestruck and grateful.

### Typing
- Do you prefer typing or handwriting?
> Well, I definitely prefer typing over handwriting these days. It's simply much faster and more efficient for me to get my thoughts down, especially for longer texts. Plus, editing and correcting mistakes is a breeze, which saves a lot of time and effort.

- Do you type on a desktop or laptop keyboard every day?
> Well, yes, I definitely use a keyboard every single day, whether it's for work or personal tasks. It's pretty essential for my daily routine, especially for typing reports and communicating online. I've become quite fast at typing, which really helps me get things done efficiently.

- When did you learn how to type on a keyboard?
> Well, I first learned how to type on a keyboard during my primary school years, probably around the age of 8 or 9. It was part of our computer class, where we used educational software to practice finger placement and speed. I found it quite engaging and actually enjoyed those lessons a lot.

- How do you improve your typing?
> Well, I mainly improve my typing skills through consistent practice. I mean, it's quite essential for my daily work and studies, so I try to type regularly. Sometimes, I also use online typing tutors to refine my speed and accuracy.

### Pets and Animals
- What's your favourite animal? Why?
> Well, if I had to pick just one animal, I'd say I'm a big fan of dogs. I mean, they are incredibly intelligent and loyal companions, always there to greet you with a wagging tail. Their playful nature and unconditional affection really bring a lot of joy and companionship into people's lives.

- Where do you prefer to keep your pet, indoors or outdoors?
> Well, I definitely prefer to keep my pets indoors, especially since I live in an apartment. It's safer for them, and it allows me to spend more quality time with them. This way, they're always close by, and I can interact with them constantly.

- Have you ever had a pet before?
> Well, yes, I have had a pet before, specifically a lovely Toy Poodle named Seven. He was a very friendly and playful dog, always full of energy and eager to go for walks. I really enjoyed his companionship; he was truly a part of our family.

- What is the most popular animal in China?
> Well, I'd say dogs are probably the most popular animals in China, especially as pets. This is mainly because they are known for their loyalty and companionship, making them ideal family members. You can find them in almost every household, both in urban and rural areas.

### Sports team
- Have you ever been part of a sports team?
> Well, to be honest, I haven't really been part of an organized sports team. I've always preferred individual sports like swimming or running, which don't require a team setup. However, I do enjoy watching team sports and appreciate the camaraderie among players.

- Is team sports popular in your culture?
> Oh, absolutely! Team sports are incredibly popular in my culture, especially among young people. I think it's because they offer a fantastic way to promote teamwork and build strong friendships. For instance, football and basketball leagues are a really big deal here, drawing huge crowds.

- Do you like watching team games? Why?
> Absolutely, I'm a big fan of watching team games, especially sports like basketball or football. I find the teamwork and strategic play incredibly engaging, and the atmosphere is always electric. It's really inspiring to see athletes push their limits, and it's just great entertainment.

- What are the differences between team sports and individual sports?
> Absolutely, I'm a big fan of watching team games, especially sports like basketball or football. I find the teamwork and strategic play incredibly engaging, and the atmosphere is always electric. It's really inspiring to see athletes push their limits, and it's just great entertainment.

### Walking
- Do you walk a lot?
> Well, I'd say I walk quite a lot, especially since I don't own a car. It's a great way for me to stay active and clear my head after a long day. I usually walk to work, and on weekends, I enjoy taking longer strolls in the park.

- Did you often go outside to have a walk when you were a child?
> Well, yes, I certainly did enjoy going for walks quite often when I was a child. It was a fantastic way to explore nature and simply unwind from the day's activities. My parents would often take me to the local park where I'd spend hours playing and observing various things around me.

- Why do people like to walk in parks?
> Well, I think many people are really fond of walking in parks. It's mainly because parks offer a natural environment, allowing them to relax and escape from city life. They can enjoy fresh air and the sight of lush greenery, which is quite refreshing.

- Where would you like to take a long walk if you had the chance?
> Well, if I had the chance, I'd definitely choose to take a long walk along a beautiful coastline. The sound of the waves and the fresh sea breeze always help me relax and clear my mind. Especially during sunset, the vibrant colors in the sky would make it an absolutely breathtaking experience.

- Where did you go for a walk lately?
> Well, I actually went for a walk in a local park just last weekend. It's a really lovely place with lots of trees and a small lake, perfect for a leisurely stroll. I wanted to clear my head and enjoy some fresh air after a busy week.

### Reading
- Do you like reading?
> Absolutely, I'm a big fan of reading, especially when I have some free time to unwind. It's a fantastic way to relax and also to learn new things, whether it's fiction or non-fiction. I usually enjoy diving into a good novel before bed, which helps me clear my mind.

- Do you prefer to read on paper or on a screen?
> Well, I definitely lean towards reading on paper rather than on a screen, especially for longer texts. I find the physical sensation of holding a book and turning pages to be much more engaging, and it helps me concentrate better. Plus, staring at a screen for extended periods tends to strain my eyes, which is something I prefer to avoid.

- When do you need to read carefully, and when not?
> Well, I think I definitely need to read carefully when I'm dealing with academic papers or important contracts. On the other hand, I don't usually read carefully when I'm browsing social media posts or casual news articles online. The former requires precision and understanding, while the latter is more for quick information or entertainment.

- Do you prefer scanning or detailed reading?
> Well, I definitely lean towards detailed reading rather than just scanning. This is mainly because I enjoy fully grasping the content and absorbing information thoroughly. It simply enhances my overall reading experience, whether it's for studying or pleasure.

### Gifts
- Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?
> Oh, absolutely, I'm quite a fan of giving handmade gifts, especially for close friends and family. I feel they carry a lot more personal touch and sincerity compared to store-bought items. For instance, I often make personalized cards or small crafts for birthdays and special occasions.

- Have you ever received a great gift?
> Oh, absolutely, I've been fortunate enough to receive some truly wonderful gifts throughout my life. One that immediately comes to mind is a handmade scarf my grandmother knitted for me a few years ago. It's not just a scarf; it's a cherished keepsake that holds immense sentimental value for me.

- What do you consider when choosing a gift?
> Well, when choosing a gift, I primarily consider the recipient's preferences and interests. This is crucial because I want the gift to be genuinely useful and appreciated, rather than just a token. Also, I usually take into account my budget and the specific occasion to ensure suitability.

- Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?
> Well, to be honest, I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at choosing gifts, as it's something I often struggle with. I usually find it quite challenging to pick out the perfect present, often because I overthink what the recipient might genuinely like or need. My main concern is usually whether the gift will be practical and truly appreciated, rather than just being something to put aside.

- What gift have you received recently?
> Well, I recently received a coffee machine as a gift, which was a pleasant surprise. It was from a close friend for my birthday, and I've been wanting one for ages. It's incredibly practical and I absolutely love it.

### Morning time
- Do you like getting up early in the morning?
> Well, yes, I'm actually quite a morning person and really enjoy getting up early. It's usually the quietest part of the day, which allows me to focus and be productive without distractions. I often use this time for a quick workout or to plan my day ahead, which sets a positive tone.

- What do you usually do in the morning?
> Well, I usually wake up around 7 AM and the first thing I do is check my phone for messages and news updates. After that, I'll quickly get ready for work, which includes brushing my teeth and getting dressed. I find this routine quite efficient and it helps me start my day smoothly.

- What did you do in the morning when you were little? Why?
> Well, when I was little, my mornings often involved playing with my toys, especially building blocks or action figures. This was mainly because my parents would be getting ready for work, and I had some free time before they left. I really enjoyed creating different structures and imaginary worlds during that quiet time.

- Are there any differences between what you do in the morning nowand what you did in the past?
> Oh, absolutely, there are some pretty significant differences in my morning routine now compared to the past. Back then, I used to have a more relaxed start, often enjoying a leisurely breakfast and reading. However, these days, my mornings are much more structured and fast-paced, mainly due to work commitments.

- Do you spend your mornings doing the same things on both weekends and weekdays? Why?
> Well, not really, my morning routines differ quite a bit between weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, I'm usually rushing to get ready for work, but weekends are much more relaxed, allowing for a slower pace. I often enjoy a leisurely breakfast or even cook a bigger meal on Saturdays and Sundays.

### Hobby
- Do you have any hobbies?
> Yes, I do have a hobby, which is amateur radio communication. It involves setting up antennas and radio equipment to transmit and receive signals. I also enjoy learning new knowledge about electronics and communication theories.

- Did you have any hobbies when you were a child?
> Yes, when I was a child, my main hobby was photography. I used to take pictures of landscapes, especially during family trips. It gave me a great sense of joy to capture beautiful moments and preserve memories.

- Do you have a hobby that you’ve had since childhood?
> Yes, photography has been a hobby of mine since childhood. I enjoy it because it allows me to capture beautiful moments in life. Additionally, I love sharing my photos with friends and family.

- Do you have the same hobbies as your family members?
> No, I don't really share the same hobbies as my family members. However, we do often travel together, which is something we all enjoy. Besides traveling, we also like to cook meals together, especially during holidays.

### Keys
- Do you always bring a lot of keys with you?
> Well, not really; I usually only carry the essential ones with me. I prefer to keep my pockets and bag as light as possible. Plus, many places now use smart locks or keycards, so physical keys are becoming less necessary.

- Have you ever lost your keys？
> Well, yes, I have misplaced my keys on a couple of occasions, which was quite inconvenient. One time, I distinctly remember leaving them somewhere near my apartment building. It was really frustrating, as I couldn't get into my place for a while.

- Do you often forget the keys and lock yourself out？
> Well, not very often, but it does happen occasionally that I forget my keys and get locked out. I guess it's mostly due to being a bit absent-minded when I'm in a hurry or distracted. Usually, I have to call a family member or a friend to let me in, which can be quite inconvenient.

- Do you think it's a good idea to leave your keys with a neighbour?
> Well, I think it’s generally a good idea to leave your keys with a trusted neighbour. It offers peace of mind, especially for emergencies or when you're away on holiday, ensuring someone can access your home. However, it absolutely hinges on having a strong, trusting relationship with them.

## Part2 & Part 3
### 乐于助人的人

- Describe a person who often helps others. 
  You should say: 
  Who this person is? 
  How often he/she helps others?
  How/why he/she helps others? 
  And how you feel about this person?
> Well, I'd like to talk about one of my closest friends, Sarah, who truly embodies the spirit of helpfulness. She's incredibly kind-hearted and compassionate, always looking for opportunities to lend a hand. What I mean is, she's not just passively empathetic; she actively participates in various volunteer activities, which really sets her apart. One particular instance that really stands out to me is when she volunteered for the Asian Winter Games a few years ago. You know, it was a massive event, and the commitment required was immense, but she dedicated herself fully to ensuring everything ran smoothly. I was truly impressed and deeply moved by her dedication. It wasn't just about helping out; it was about her genuine desire to contribute to something bigger than herself and make a positive impact on the community. Her actions constantly inspire me to be more considerate and helpful in my own life.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我最亲密的朋友之一,莎拉,她真正体现了乐于助人的精神。她非常善良和富有同情心,总是寻找机会伸出援手。我的意思是,她不仅仅是被动的同理心;她积极参与各种志愿者活动,这确实让她与众不同。一个真正让我印象深刻的例子是几年前她志愿参加亚冬会。你知道,这是一个巨大的事件,所需的承诺是巨大的,但她全身心地投入,以确保一切顺利进行。她的奉献精神给我留下了深刻的印象和深深的感动。这不仅仅是帮助,这是关于她真正的愿望,为比自己更大的事情做出贡献,并对社区产生积极的影响。她的行为不断激励我在自己的生活中更加体贴和乐于助人。

- What can children do to help their parents?
> Children can help their parents in very practical ways. It doesn’t have to be something big.
When kids share small tasks, parents feel less stressed. It also makes the home atmosphere better.
There are two main ways. One is doing simple chores. The other is giving emotional support, like being considerate and communicating.
For example, they can wash the dishes, tidy up, or take out the trash. They can also check in on their parents and spend a bit of time with them.
> 我觉得孩子帮父母，其实可以从很具体的小事做起，不一定要做什么“大事”。
孩子分担一点小任务，父母就会省心省力，家里的氛围也会更好。
我觉得主要就两个方向：一是家务分担，二是情绪支持，比如主动沟通、少顶嘴、多体谅。
比如做一些简单家务，洗碗、收拾、倒垃圾都行。再比如多关心父母，问一句、陪一会儿，这些其实挺有用的。

- Should children help their parents with household chores?
> Yes, I think children should help with household chores, at least a little. It’s not about using kids as free workers. It’s about learning responsibility.
  Of course school is important, and kids get tired too. But if they never do any chores, they may grow up not knowing how to take care of themselves. They may also take their parents’ work for granted.
  For example, children can clean their own room. They can also do simple tasks like taking out the trash or washing dishes after dinner.
  When children help regularly, they become more independent. They also understand their parents better. That’s good for the family.
> 我觉得应该帮一点，至少做一些力所能及的家务。重点不是把孩子当免费劳动力，而是让他学会责任感和家庭分工。
当然学习也重要，孩子也会累。但如果从小完全不做家务，长大后很可能不会照顾自己，也容易把父母的付出当成理所当然。
比如孩子可以整理自己的房间，或者做一些简单的事，比如倒垃圾、饭后洗碗。
孩子长期参与家务，会更独立，也更能理解父母的辛苦。对家庭氛围也更好。

- What kind of help do people need when looking for a new job?
> When people look for a new job, they often need help with information and preparation. Some people also need connections, but the first two are the basics.
Many people are not bad at work. They just don’t know which jobs fit them. They also don’t know how to show their strengths in a clear way.
For example, they may need someone to improve their resume. They may also need a mock interview to practice answers.
With the right help, job hunting becomes faster and less stressful. Without it, people may apply randomly and feel more anxious.
> 我觉得找新工作最需要的帮助主要是信息和准备。有些人也需要人脉，但前两者是基础。
很多人其实不是能力不行，而是不知道哪些岗位适合自己，也不知道怎么把优势说清楚。
比如需要别人帮忙改简历；也可能需要做模拟面试，练练怎么回答。
如果有人指导，找工作会更快、更稳；但如果没人帮，很容易乱投，越找越焦虑。

- Who should people ask for help, colleagues or family members? 
> I think it depends on what kind of help you need. For work-related help, colleagues are usually better. For emotional support, family members are often better.
Colleagues understand your industry. They know what employers want, and they can give practical advice. Family can be very supportive, but they may not know the details. Sometimes they only say “don’t worry”, which doesn’t solve the problem.
For example, if you want feedback on your resume or interview answers, a colleague can help more. But if you feel stressed and you just need someone to listen, family is a better choice.
So I’d say choose the right person for the right problem. That saves time, and it also avoids awkward situations.
> 我觉得要看你需要什么帮助。跟工作相关的，通常问同事更合适；如果是情绪支持，家人往往更合适。
同事懂行业，也更清楚面试官想看什么，所以建议更实用。家人当然会支持你，但他们可能不了解细节。有时候他们只会说“别担心”，但问题还在。
比如你想让人看看简历、帮你改改面试回答，同事更能帮上忙；但如果你压力很大，只是想有人听你说几句，那找家人更好。
所以我会说：对事找人。这样更省时间，也能避免尴尬。

- Do you think schools should teach children to do household chores? 
> Yes, I think schools should teach children basic household chores. It’s very practical, and it helps kids become more independent.
For example, they can learn simple cleaning and how to keep their space organised. They can also learn basic cooking, like making an easy meal safely.
When kids know these skills, they rely less on their parents. They also understand responsibility and teamwork better. In daily life, they become more considerate at home.
So I don’t think it needs to take a lot of class time. Schools can do short workshops or simple hands-on activities.
> 我觉得学校应该教孩子做家务，至少把基础的教一下，真的很实用。
比如最基本的清洁、整理收纳这类，孩子都用得上。再比如教一点简单做饭，重点是安全，比如怎么用火、怎么用电。
孩子会这些技能之后，就没那么依赖父母了，也更懂责任和分工。在家里也会更体谅父母一点。
而且这事儿不需要占很多课时。学校用短课程或者实践活动带一下就够了。

- Why are employees reluctant to ask their managers for help?
> Many employees are reluctant to ask their managers for help because they worry about how they look. They don’t want to seem incompetent.
They may also fear it will affect performance reviews or promotion chances. And some people simply don’t want to bother their manager, so they try to handle everything alone.
For example, even when they’re stuck, they keep struggling and search online or ask colleagues first. They sometimes overthink the message too. They want to sound professional and avoid getting criticised.
But this can slow work down and cause rework. It’s often better to ask earlier and align expectations. It saves time and reduces mistakes.
> 我觉得很多员工不太愿意找经理求助，核心原因是怕“形象受损”，怕显得自己不行。
他们可能担心这会影响绩效评价、甚至影响晋升。还有的人是不想打扰领导，怕给人一种不专业、没能力的感觉，所以宁愿自己扛。
比如明明卡住了，也会先自己搜、先问同事，能拖就拖。发消息前还会反复纠结措辞，怕被怼、怕被批评。
但这样往往会让进度更慢，还容易返工。很多时候更好的方式是早点问、早点把预期对齐，反而更省时间也更稳。

### 花费超过预期的物品
- Describe an item on which you spent more than expected. 
  You should say: 
  What it is? 
  How much you spent on it? 
  Why you bought it? 
  And explain why you think you spent more than expected?
> Well, I'd like to talk about a second-hand Sigma wide-angle lens that I bought, which definitely cost me more than I initially expected. This particular lens is renowned for its exceptional performance in astrophotography, capturing stunning night sky images with incredible detail and clarity. I originally purchased it specifically for astrophotography, as I've always been fascinated by the cosmos and wanted to capture its beauty. I spent a bit more than planned because I was looking for a specific model that was hard to find used, and its condition was almost new, which justified the higher price tag. Ultimately, this lens has become more than just a piece of equipment; it has truly inspired me to explore new places and delve deeper into the art of photography, constantly pushing my creative boundaries. It's an investment that has paid off in experiences and personal growth.
> 好吧，我想谈谈我买的一个二手Sigma广角镜头，它的价格肯定比我最初预期的要高。这款特殊的镜头因其在天体.摄影方面的卓越性能而闻名，可以以令人难以置信的细节和清晰度 捕捉令人惊叹的夜空图像。我最初购买它是专门为了天文摄影，因为我一直对宇宙着迷并想捕捉它的美丽。我花的钱比计划多一点，因为我正在寻找一种很难找到使用过的特定型号，而且它的状况几乎是新的，这证明了更高的价格是合理的。 最终，这个镜头不仅仅是一件设备；它真正激励我探索新的地方，更深入地研究摄影艺术，不断突破我的创作界限。这是一项在经验和个人成长方面得到了回报的投资。

- Do you often buy more than you expected?
> Yes, sometimes I do, especially online. I often go in for one thing. Then I come out with three.
For example, I might buy some daily items first. Then I add snacks because they look tempting. Or I see “second one half price” and I buy an extra one.
Online shopping makes this easy. The app keeps showing “You may also like”. It also pushes deals and free shipping. It feels smart to add more, but it’s not always true.
Now I try to set a small budget. I also stick to a simple list. It helps me buy what I actually need.
会的，偶尔会，尤其网购的时候更容易。我经常本来只想买一件，最后变成买了三件。
比如先买点日用品，然后看到零食很诱人就加了；或者看到“第二件半价”，就顺手多买一份。
网购特别容易让人这样。它一直给你推“猜你喜欢”，还用折扣和包邮来刺激你。你会觉得多加点很划算，但其实不一定。
所以我现在会先定个小预算，也会写个简单清单。这样比较不容易越买越多。

- What do you think young people spend most of their money on?
> I think young people spend most of their money on two things. One is basic living costs. The other is daily entertainment.
Living costs are hard to avoid. Rent, food, and transport take a big part of the budget, especially in big cities.
After that, many young people spend on things that make life feel better. They pay for streaming or game memberships. They also spend money on social life.
For example, rent plus takeout can already be a lot. And some people also buy subscriptions or go out with friends on weekends.
So money goes fast. Saving becomes harder. But at the same time, these things help them relax and stay connected.
我觉得年轻人花钱最多的主要就两块：一块是生活成本，一块是日常娱乐。
生活成本很难躲开，尤其在大城市。房租、吃饭、通勤会占掉很大一部分预算。
剩下的钱，很多人就会花在让自己“过得舒服一点”的东西上，比如会员、游戏，或者社交活动。
比如光是房租加外卖就已经很贵了；然后有的人还会买各种订阅，或者周末和朋友出去吃饭。
所以钱真的花得很快，存钱会更难。但这些支出也能带来放松和社交，不完全是坏事。

- Do you think it is important to save money? Why?
> Yes, I think saving money is important. It gives you peace of mind. Life has surprises, and you don’t want to panic when something happens.
For example, you might get sick or your phone breaks. These small problems can become big stress if you have no savings. Another example is changing jobs. If you want to quit, some savings can give you a buffer.
Saving also makes you feel more in control. You can make choices more calmly. You don’t have to say yes to every job or every situation just because you need money right now.
So I think saving matters, but it should be realistic. Keep an emergency fund first, and then enjoy life with the rest.
我觉得存钱是重要的，因为它会给人安全感。生活总会有意外，你不想一出事就慌。
比如突然生病，或者手机坏了，这种小事如果你没存款就会变成大压力。再比如你想换工作，如果手里有点储备，就能有缓冲，不用被迫硬撑。
存钱也会让人更有掌控感，做决定更从容。你不需要因为“马上缺钱”就对所有情况都只能点头。
所以我觉得存钱重要，但也要现实一点。先把应急钱存出来，剩下的再去享受生活。

- Do people buy things they don’t need?
> Yes, people do. It happens a lot, especially with online shopping.
For example, someone watches a short video and suddenly wants the same product. Or they see a “limited-time sale” and add extra items to the cart.
Many purchases are not real needs. They are more about feelings. People buy things when they are stressed or bored. They want a quick reward. Apps also push products all the time, so it’s easy to click “buy”.
The problem is the happiness is short. Later, people may regret it, and the extra stuff piles up. It also makes saving money harder.
会的，而且挺常见的，尤其网购更容易发生。
比如刷到一个种草视频，突然就想买同款；或者看到“限时折扣”，就顺手在购物车里多加点东西。
很多消费其实不是刚需，而是情绪。压力大、无聊的时候，人就想奖励自己一下。再加上平台一直推推荐，点一下就买了。
问题是快乐很短，之后可能就后悔，而且东西会越堆越多。钱也花得更快，存钱就更难了。

- Do you think it is the rich people’s responsibility to donate money to people in need?
> I don’t think it should be treated as a strict responsibility. But I do think it’s a good thing for rich people to donate.
They have more resources, so their money can make a real difference quickly. It can also support charities and help society run more smoothly.
However, if donating becomes moral pressure, it can backfire. People may do it just for image, or they may even try to avoid it.
So I think the best way is to encourage voluntary giving. At the same time, we need clear rules and transparency, so donations actually reach people in need.
我不觉得这应该被当成一种“必须承担的责任”，但我确实认为富人捐款是件好事，也应该被鼓励。
他们资源更多，所以捐款可能更快、更直接地帮到需要的人，也能支持公益机构，让社会运转更稳定一些。
但如果把捐款变成一种道德绑架，反而可能适得其反。有人会为了形象做表面功夫，甚至有人会更反感、更想躲。
所以我觉得更合理的是：以自愿为主，同时用制度去引导，比如透明的公益机制、合理的税收和监管，让帮助更持续、更有效。

- What kind of things are people happy to pay a high price for?
> People are happy to pay a high price for things that feel truly worth it. Usually it’s about peace of mind and long-term value.
When something is expensive but reliable, people worry less. They also feel the experience is better, so the price seems justified.
Two big areas are education and health. Education can improve your skills and your future options. Health-related spending can make you feel safer, because you’re taking care of your body.
So it’s not just about buying a product. People are paying for confidence, comfort, and a better future.
我觉得大家愿意花高价的东西，往往是那种“价值感很强”的。
价格高一点但品质靠谱，人会更放心，也更省心，用起来体验更好，就会觉得值。
一般最典型的两类就是教育和健康。教育能提升能力，也能带来更好的机会。健康相关的支出会让人更安心，因为是在照顾身体。
所以大家买的不是单纯一个东西，而是安全感、舒适感，以及一种更好的未来预期。

### 鼓励别人做不愿做的事

- Describe a time when you encouraged someone to do something that he/she didn't want to do.
  You should say:
  Who he or she is?
  What you encouraged him/her to do?
  How he/she reacted?
  And explain why you encouraged him/her to do it?
> Well, I'd like to talk about a time when I encouraged my friend, Sarah, to do something she was really hesitant about. She was reluctant to apply for a scholarship because she was terrified of failure, having faced a few setbacks in the past. I tried to encourage her by sitting down and analyzing the potential reasons for failure, not to dwell on them, but to strategize how to overcome them. I also reminded her of her strengths and past achievements, emphasizing that this was a valuable learning opportunity regardless of the outcome. To my delight, she eventually submitted her application, and even better, she actually won the scholarship! I was incredibly proud of her for stepping out of her comfort zone and facing her fears. It was a truly rewarding experience to see her succeed and grow.
> 嗯,我想谈谈有一次我鼓励我的朋友莎拉做一些她真正犹豫的事情。她不愿意申请奖学金,因为她害怕失败,过去也遇到过一些挫折。我试图通过坐下来分析失败的潜在原因来鼓励她,不是纠缠在它们上,而是制定如何克服它们的策略。我还提醒她自己的优势和过去的成就,强调无论结果如何,这都是一个宝贵的学习机会。令我高兴的是,她最终提交了申请,更好的是,她竟然赢得了奖学金!我为她走出舒适区并面对恐惧感到无比自豪。看到她成功和成长是一次真正有益的经历。

- How can leaders encourage their employees?
> Leaders can encourage employees by giving real recognition and real support. Empty slogans don’t help much.
For example, they can praise people for specific work, either in public or in private. They can also set clear goals and provide the tools people need. When someone does well, a small reward or a new opportunity can be a strong push.
It also matters how leaders communicate. Feedback should be clear and specific. And employees need room to grow, so it’s okay to make small mistakes sometimes.
When people feel valued and supported, they usually work harder. They also take more responsibility. The team becomes more stable, and it’s easier to keep good staff.
我觉得领导想鼓励员工，最有效的是“认可+支持”，比喊口号更有用。
比如员工做得好，可以当众表扬，也可以私下肯定，而且最好说具体哪里做得好。再比如给清晰的目标和必要的资源，让人知道怎么做、用什么做。表现好的时候给点小奖励，或者给更多机会，也会很鼓舞人。
另外沟通方式也很关键，反馈要清楚、具体。员工也需要成长空间，所以允许小范围试错，会让人更敢做事。
当员工觉得自己被重视、被支持，他们动力会更强，也更愿意承担责任。团队效率会更稳定，留人也更容易。

- When should parents encourage their children?
> Parents should encourage their children at key moments. It’s not only after they succeed.
When encouragement comes at the right time, kids become more willing to try. They’re also less afraid of failing. If parents only praise results, children may get anxious and avoid mistakes.
I think it’s better to encourage the process, like effort and progress. Parents can also step in when a child feels low. It helps the child calm down first.
For example, after a bad exam, parents can praise the effort and then talk about a better plan. And when a child gets stuck learning a new skill, parents can notice their persistence and break the task into smaller steps.
我觉得父母应该在一些关键时刻鼓励孩子，而不是只在孩子成功之后才夸。
鼓励给得及时，孩子会更敢尝试，也不那么怕失败。如果父母只盯结果，孩子可能会更焦虑，更怕犯错。
我更倾向于鼓励过程，比如努力、进步这些，让孩子知道自己方向没错。孩子状态低落的时候，父母也应该托一把，先把情绪稳住再说。
比如考试考砸了，父母可以先肯定努力，再一起聊怎么改进。孩子学新技能卡住时，也可以先夸他坚持，然后把任务拆小一点，让他更容易继续下去。

- What kind of encouragement should parents give?
> I think parents should give encouragement that is specific and honest. It works best when it focuses on effort and progress.
Sure, parents can praise results too. But it’s better not to only say things like “You’re so smart.” That kind of praise doesn’t teach kids what they did right.
If parents only give empty compliments or only care about scores, kids may feel a lot of pressure. Some kids even stop trying new things because they’re scared of failing.
So the best encouragement is clear feedback plus a small next step. Tell the child what improved, and suggest what to do next. That helps them build real confidence.
我觉得父母的鼓励最好是具体、真诚的，而且重点放在努力和进步上。
当然也可以夸结果，但别只夸“你很聪明”。那种夸法容易让孩子不知道自己到底做对了什么。
如果父母只给空夸，或者只盯分数，孩子压力会很大。有些孩子会变得更怕失败，反而不敢尝试新东西。
所以更好的鼓励是：给清楚的反馈，再给一个小的下一步。告诉孩子哪里进步了，然后建议接下来怎么做，这样自信会更稳。


- Do you think some people are better than others at persuading?
> Yes, I do. Some people are simply better at persuading than others.
They usually understand people. They listen first, and they know what the other person cares about. Then they explain their point clearly and calmly. It feels natural, not pushy.
If someone just keeps pushing or lecturing, it often backfires. The other person gets defensive, and they stop listening.
The good news is persuasion is a skill. You can train it. If you practice listening and speaking in a clearer way, you’ll get much better over time.
我觉得是的，确实有些人比别人更擅长说服。
他们通常很懂人，会先听对方在乎什么、卡点在哪，然后再用更清楚、更冷静的方式把观点讲出来。听起来就很自然，不会让人觉得被硬推。
反过来，如果一个人一直强推，或者像上课一样讲大道理，往往会适得其反。对方会立刻进入防御状态，反而更不想听。
好消息是，说服力其实是可以练的技能。学会倾听，再把表达结构化一点，大多数人都会慢慢变强。

- Should children do everything their parents ask them to do?
> No, I don’t think children should do everything their parents ask. But they should still respect their parents and listen most of the time.
Parents usually have more experience, and many requests are about safety and good habits. In those cases, it makes sense to follow them.
However, if a child always obeys without thinking, it can be harmful. They may not learn to make decisions, and they can be easily influenced by others.
So the better approach is communication. Parents should explain the reason, and children should ask questions politely. For rules about safety, kids should follow. For personal choices, they should have some space.
我觉得不应该“什么都照做”，但同时也要尊重父母，该听的还是得听。
父母一般经验更多，很多要求其实是为了安全和习惯，这种情况下听了通常没坏处。
但如果孩子永远只会服从，不动脑子，就会出问题。他们很难学会做决定，也更容易被别人带偏。
所以更好的方式是沟通。父母解释清楚理由，孩子也礼貌地提问。安全类的规则要听，个人选择类的事情应该给孩子一些空间。

- How can employers encourage their staff?
> I think employers can encourage staff by making them feel valued and supported.
Pay matters, but money alone isn’t enough. People also want recognition and growth.
For example, managers can praise good work in a specific way. They can also offer training or resources, so employees feel they can improve.
When staff feel appreciated, they usually work with more energy. They’re also more likely to stay, and the team atmosphere becomes better.
我觉得雇主鼓励员工，最有效的是让员工感觉“被看见、被支持”。
钱当然重要，但光靠加薪不够，认可感和成长空间也得跟上。
比如做得好要及时表扬，而且最好表扬得具体一点。再比如提供培训或资源，让员工感觉自己在进步。
员工一旦觉得被重视，动力通常会更足，也更愿意留下来，团队氛围也会更好。

### 近期观影
- Describe a movie you watched and enjoyed recently.
  You should say:
  When and where you watched it?
  Who you watched it with?
  What it was about?
  And explain why you watched this movie?
> Well, the movie I'd like to talk about is "Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles," which is a classic detective film. I watched it recently at home, actually, just last weekend, on a cozy Saturday evening. It's essentially a captivating mystery story about Sherlock Holmes investigating a legendary curse and a mysterious death on the gloomy moors of Dartmoor. I thoroughly enjoyed it because the plot was incredibly engaging, full of suspense, and the characters were brilliantly portrayed.
> 好吧,我想谈论的电影是《夏洛克·福尔摩斯:巴斯克维尔的猎犬》,这是一部经典侦探电影。我最近在家里看了它,事实上,就在上周末,在一个舒适的周六晚上。这本质上是一个引人入胜的悬疑故事,讲述了夏洛克·福尔摩斯在达特穆尔阴沉的荒原上调查传奇诅咒和神秘死亡的故事。我非常喜欢它,因为情节非常引人入胜,充满悬念,而且人物也被出色地描绘。

- What kinds of movies do you think are successful in your country?
> In China, I think a successful movie is either story-driven or very enjoyable to watch. People pay for a good feeling, not just a famous name.
If the story is strong, people talk about it and recommend it. If the cinema experience is great, people feel it’s worth the money. But if a film only has hype, the interest drops fast after the first week.
For example, comedies and family movies often do well because they are easy to enjoy. Big action or sci-fi films can also be successful, because they look much better on a big screen.
So for me, a “successful” movie is simple. It has to be good inside, and it has to feel worth the ticket.
在中国，我觉得成功的电影通常就两种：要么故事特别抓人，要么观影体验特别爽。大家买票不是为了“看看明星”，而是为了那种观影感受。
如果故事够强，大家就会聊、就会安利；如果大银幕体验够好，观众会觉得值。反过来，如果只是靠营销炒热度，第一周过了就很容易降温。
比如喜剧和家庭片往往比较容易出圈，因为轻松好看；大制作的动作或科幻也容易成功，因为放在电影院确实更震撼。
所以我理解的“成功”很简单：内容要撑得住，而且看完要觉得值回票价。

- What are the factors that make a successful movie?
> I think a successful movie needs a strong core, like a solid story, believable characters, and good pacing. These are the things that keep people watching.
If a film only relies on flashy visuals or a big marketing push, it’s easy to forget. People may watch it once, and that’s it. 
When the characters make sense and the emotions build naturally, viewers get invested. Acting and music can also lift the whole experience.
That’s why truly successful movies spread through word of mouth and stay popular longer.
我觉得一部电影要成功，首先得有“硬核内容”，比如故事扎实、人物可信、节奏舒服。这样观众才会一直看下去。
反过来，如果它主要靠大场面或者营销，内容又撑不住，那基本就是看完就忘。很多人只看一次就结束了。
当人物动机清楚、情绪铺垫自然，观众会更投入。演员和配乐也能把整体氛围顶上去。
所以真正成功的片子往往是靠口碑传播，而且能火得更久。

- Do Chinese people prefer to watch domestic movies or foreign movies?
> I don’t think Chinese people always prefer domestic or foreign movies. Most people choose based on the genre and the word of mouth.
If a movie is genuinely good, people will pay for it. They’ll also recommend it to friends.
But if it’s just average, people won’t buy a ticket. They don’t really care where it’s made.
In general, stories that feel close to daily life in China work well as domestic films. For a strong visual experience, many people go for big Hollywood action movies.
我不觉得中国人一定更偏国产或者更偏国外。更多时候大家就是看类型和口碑。
电影真好看，观众就愿意掏钱。看完还会顺手安利给朋友。
但如果就一般般，观众也不会买账。这个时候是哪国拍的其实不重要。
通常贴近国内日常生活的故事，看国产会更容易代入。要是想追求视觉冲击，很多人就会去看好莱坞动作大片。

- Do you think only well-known directors can create the best movies?
> Not really. I don’t think only well-known directors can make the best movies. Fame doesn’t equal quality.
Well-known directors do have advantages. They have bigger budgets and stronger teams. They can also attract good scripts and top actors more easily.
But if we only trust famous directors, we leave no space for new talent. We might also miss unexpected “dark horse” movies.
In the end, the movie itself matters most. New directors can create masterpieces, and famous directors can still make a bad film.
我不太同意，只有知名导演才能拍出最好的电影。名气不等于质量。
当然名导确实有优势，比如预算更大、团队更成熟，也更容易拿到好剧本和好演员。
但如果我们只认名导，新人就很难被看见，观众也可能错过一些黑马作品。
所以最后还是回到作品本身。新人也能拍出神作，名导也可能翻车。

- Do you think successful movies should have well-known actors or actresses in leading roles?
> Not necessarily. A successful movie doesn’t have to rely on famous leads, but big names can help.
Well-known actors can bring attention. They can also make it easier to sell tickets at the start. But long-term success depends on the story and performance, not just fame.
For example, big commercial films often use stars to play it safe. It helps with the opening box office. But some small films with new faces still go viral, because the characters feel real and the plot is strong.
So I’d say stars are a bonus, not the core. Casting should be about fit. The lead needs to match the role.
我觉得不一定必须用大牌主演，但大牌有时候确实会加分。
知名演员能带来关注度，也更容易让电影一开始卖得动票。但电影能不能真的成功，还是看故事和表演，而不是靠名气硬撑。
比如商业大片用明星更稳，开局票房通常更好。但也有小成本电影用新人照样出圈，因为角色很真实、剧情够扎实。
所以我更倾向于：明星是加成，不是核心。选角更应该看的是“适不适合这个角色”。

- Why do people prefer to watch movies in the cinema?
> I think people go to the cinema because the experience feels more immersive. The big screen and the sound system make a huge difference.
It’s also easier to focus there. The lights are off and your phone isn’t supposed to be out. You get pulled into the story much faster.
At home, it’s the opposite. You pause for messages, snacks, or random chores. Even a small interruption can break the mood.
So for a lot of people, the cinema just hits differently. They pay for that “full experience,” and it usually feels more satisfying.
我觉得大家更爱去电影院，主要是因为体验更沉浸。大屏幕加上音响，带来的冲击感在家里很难复刻。
而且在电影院更容易专注。灯一关，你基本不会一直刷手机，很快就能被剧情带进去。
在家看就相反了。你会随时暂停回消息、拿零食、做点杂事，哪怕一个小打断都可能把氛围搞没。
所以对很多人来说，影院的感觉就是更“到位”。花钱买的是完整体验，整体也更容易觉得值。

### 有趣的建筑
- Describe an interesting building.
  You should say:
  Where it is?
  What it looks like?
  What function it has?
  And explain why you think it is interesting?
> Well, when it comes to an interesting building, the first place that springs to mind is, without a doubt, the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. It's an iconic landmark that truly captivates anyone who visits. This magnificent complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site, served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It's a sprawling architectural marvel, encompassing nearly a thousand buildings with vibrant red walls and golden-tiled roofs, all meticulously arranged according to traditional Chinese cosmology. What truly fascinates me about the Forbidden City is the myriad of stories embedded within its walls, particularly those concerning the daily lives and political intrigues of the Ming and Qing emperors. You know, imagining the grand ceremonies, the intricate court affairs, and the personal dramas that unfolded there really brings history to life. Each hall and courtyard seems to whisper tales of power, ambition, and sometimes, profound solitude. Visiting the Forbidden City left me with an overwhelming sense of awe and deep respect for ancient Chinese architecture and craftsmanship. It's not just a collection of buildings; it's a profound testament to a rich cultural heritage and the incredible ingenuity of its creators. It truly is a place where history breathes.
> 嗯,说到有趣的建筑,首先想到的地方无疑是中国北京的紫禁城。这是一个标志性地标,真正吸引了任何来访的人。这座宏伟的建筑群被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产,曾是明、清两代24位皇帝的皇宫。这是一个庞大的建筑奇迹,包含近一千座建筑,拥有充满活力的红色墙壁和金色瓷砖屋顶,所有这些都按照中国传统宇宙观精心排列。紫禁城真正让我着迷的是它的城墙里蕴藏着无数的故事,尤其是那些有关明、清皇帝的日常生活和政治阴谋的故事。你知道,想象那里发生的盛大仪式、错综复杂的宫廷事务以及个人戏剧,确实让历史栩栩如生。每个大厅和庭院似乎都在低声讲述权力、野心的故事,有时甚至是深刻的孤独。参观紫禁城让我对中国古代建筑和工艺产生了压倒性的敬畏和深深的尊重。它不仅仅是一群建筑;它是丰富的文化遗产及其创造者令人难以置信的独创性的深刻证明。它确实是一个历史呼吸的地方。

- What types of buildings are popular in your country?
> In China, high-rise apartments are probably the most popular, especially in big cities. They are common because land is limited, so building upward is more practical.
Also, city life is built around convenience. People want to live close to subways, schools, and shopping areas. Apartments usually have these things nearby, so they fit daily life.
For example, many people live in high-rise apartment buildings in large cities. In suburban areas, some families prefer townhouses or houses with small gardens.
So it depends on location. Apartments are popular for convenience, while houses are popular for space and comfort.
在中国，我觉得最普遍、最受欢迎的还是城市里的高层公寓，尤其大城市特别明显。主要原因很现实：地少人多，只能往上盖。
而且城市生活本来就讲究方便，大家都想离地铁、学校、商场近一点。公寓楼通常配套更集中，日常生活会更顺。
比如很多人住的就是高层商品房/公寓楼；但在郊区，一些家庭会更喜欢联排或者带小院子的房子。
所以看地点。想图方便，多数人选公寓；想要空间和舒适，就更偏向郊区的房子。

- Is it worth spending a lot of money on the exterior appearance of a building?
> Spending a lot on the outside can be worth it, but it shouldn’t be the first priority.
A good-looking building can leave a strong impression. It can also attract people, especially for public places. But if the inside is uncomfortable, the beauty doesn’t help much.
For example, for a shopping mall or a landmark building, the exterior matters. It brings visitors and improves the image. But for normal homes, I think money should go to comfort first, like better insulation or soundproofing.
So yes, design matters, but balance matters more. A building should look nice and work well at the same time.
外观花很多钱有时候值，但它不该是第一优先级。
好看的建筑确实会给人很强的第一印象，也更容易吸引人，尤其是公共空间。但如果里面住着不舒服，那外面再漂亮也没太大意义。
比如商场或者地标建筑，外观确实重要，能吸引人、提升城市形象；但普通住宅我觉得更该先把钱花在舒适度上，比如保温、隔音。
所以外观设计当然重要，但更重要的是平衡：好看，也要好用、好住。

- Is it more important for a building to look good on the outside or on the inside?
> For most buildings, I think the inside is more important. People spend time inside, so comfort matters more than looks.
The outside still matters, of course. A nice exterior gives a good first impression. It can also make a city look better. But if the inside is dark, noisy, or badly designed, people won’t enjoy the place.
For example, for a home, things like good lighting and soundproofing are key. For public buildings like malls or museums, the exterior can attract visitors. But the inside must be easy and pleasant to use.
So I’d say the exterior is a bonus. The inside is the real value.
我觉得对大多数建筑来说，里面更重要。因为人真正待着、生活、使用的地方是在里面，舒服和实用才是核心。
外观当然也重要，它决定第一印象，也会影响城市看起来的感觉。但如果里面很暗、很吵、布局很别扭，那外面再好看也留不住人。
比如住宅最关键的是采光、隔音这些；像商场或博物馆，外观好看能吸引人，但里面得好逛、好用。
所以我会说：外观是加分项，里面才是硬实力。

- Why do people like to visit historical sites?
> I think people visit historical sites because they want a real feeling of the past. Reading a textbook is one thing, but seeing the place in person feels different.
Historical sites also have a special atmosphere. People like walking around old buildings and imagining what life was like before. It’s also a good way to take photos and enjoy a slower pace.
For example, visiting an old town or an ancient temple can feel very peaceful. Another example is walking on an old street and seeing the original buildings.
After the visit, people often understand history better. They may also feel more connected to the culture of the city.
我觉得大家喜欢去历史遗址，很多时候不是为了“学习多伟大”，而是想获得那种真实的历史感。书上看是一回事，亲眼看到完全是另一回事。
历史遗址也很有氛围。你在老建筑里走一圈，很容易去想象以前的人怎么生活。它也适合拍照打卡，而且节奏会慢一点，能换换脑子。
比如去古城或者古寺走走，会觉得很安静；再比如逛老街，看那些老房子和生活痕迹。
逛完之后，很多人对那段历史会更有概念，也会更有城市文化的连接感。

- Do you think it's reasonable to charge an entry fee for visiting interesting buildings?
> Yes, I think it’s reasonable, but only if the fee is justified.
Historic or interesting buildings cost money to maintain. Safety checks, repairs, and staff all need funding. If everything is totally free, places can get overcrowded. The building may also get damaged faster.
For example, old buildings often need regular restoration and security. Popular sites may also need crowd control and basic guided services.
So charging a fee can improve the experience and protect the place. But the price should be transparent and fair. Discounts for students or locals can also make it feel more acceptable.
我觉得合理，但前提是这个钱“收得有道理”。
很多有特色的建筑，尤其是历史建筑，维护和安全都要花钱，比如修缮、安保、消防检查等。如果完全免费，可能人会特别多，既拥挤也更容易加速损耗。
比如老建筑经常需要定期修复，还得配安保。很火的建筑也需要限流，有时还会提供一些基础讲解服务。
所以收费能提升体验，也能保护建筑本身。但价格要透明、别离谱。给学生或本地人一些优惠，也会更合理。

- Is it better to live in a new building or an old one?
> I’d choose a new building. It’s simply less stressful.
Everything is newer, so there are usually fewer problems. Safety standards are also more up to date, so you feel more secure.
For example, the wiring and plumbing are new, so you’re less likely to deal with leaks or sudden issues. Soundproofing and building security are often better too. That makes daily life quieter and easier.
Overall, a new building gives you a more stable living experience. You spend less time fixing things, and you can focus on your own life.
我会选新房，主要就是更省心。
新房各方面都更新，出问题的概率更低，而且安全标准也更新，住着更踏实。
比如电路和管线更新，漏水、跳闸这种糟心事会少很多。隔音和门禁也往往更好，日常会更安静、更安心。
总的来说，新房的居住体验更稳定，不会老是消耗你的时间和精力，你可以把注意力放在自己的生活上。

### 发挥想象力
- Describe a time you needed to use your imagination.
  You should say:
  When it was?
  Why you needed to use imagination?
  How difficult or easy it was?
  And explain how you felt about it?
> Well, I vividly recall a particular instance during my university days when I participated in the National University Electronic Design Competition, often referred to as NUEDC. This was a time when my imagination was truly put to the test. The primary challenge was the immense time pressure; we had only four days and three nights to conceptualize, design, and build a fully functional prototype. It was a daunting task that required not just technical skill but also a significant amount of creative thinking. To overcome this, I had to really stretch my imaginative muscles. I spent countless hours brainstorming unique design solutions, sketching out unconventional approaches, and envisioning how different components could interact in novel ways. It wasn't about following a textbook solution, but rather about innovating under pressure to create something truly original and effective. Ultimately, our hard work and imaginative problem-solving paid off. Our final product not only met the competition's requirements but also impressed the judges enough to win first prize. I remember feeling an immense sense of accomplishment and elation, knowing that our creativity had led to such a successful outcome.
> 嗯,我清楚地记得大学时代的一个特殊例子,当时我参加了一场电子设计竞赛,通常被称为NUEDC。这是我的想象力真正受到考验的时刻。主要的挑战是巨大的时间压力;我们只有四天三夜的时间来概念化、设计和构建一个功能齐全的原型。这是一项艰巨的任务,不仅需要技术技能,还需要大量的创造性思维。为了克服这个问题,我必须真正伸展我想象力的肌肉。我花了无数个小时集思广益独特的设计解决方案,勾勒出非常规的方法,并设想不同的组件如何以新颖的方式交互。这不是遵循教科书中的解决方案,而是在压力下进行创新,以创造真正原创和有效的东西。最终,我们的辛勤工作和富有想象力的问题解决得到了回报。我们的最终产品不仅满足了比赛的要求,而且给评委留下了足够的印象,赢得了一等奖。我记得我感到巨大的成就感和自豪感,因为我知道我们的创造力导致了如此成功的结果。

- Do you think adults can have lots of imagination?
> Yes, adults can have a lot of imagination. I’m pretty sure about that.
If adults had no imagination, many things wouldn’t work. New products wouldn’t appear, and many daily problems would stay unsolved.
For example, people in product or marketing roles need fresh ideas all the time. They have to plan new campaigns and write new content. Also, many adults use imagination at home. They find smart ways to organize things and save time.
So I think adults do have imagination. It’s just more practical. It’s used to solve problems, not only to play.
我觉得成年人当然也能很有想象力，这点我还挺确定的。
反过来想，如果成年人真的没想象力，很多东西其实就运转不起来。新产品很难做出来，很多生活里的麻烦也解决不了。
比如做产品或运营的人要不断想新活动、新文案；还有很多人在家里也会动脑子，比如想办法收纳、想办法省时间。
所以我觉得成年人不是没想象力，而是更“实用型”。它更多用来解决问题，而不是单纯拿来玩。

- Do you think imagination is essential for scientists?
> Yes, I think imagination is essential for scientists. But it has to work with evidence.
Science is strict. Scientists need data and careful tests. At the same time, they need imagination to ask new questions. They also need it to think of possible explanations.
For example, a scientist may first guess what is happening. Then they design an experiment to check it. Without that first guess, they may not know where to start.
So imagination helps scientists explore new directions. Evidence helps them stay correct. Both are necessary.
我觉得想象力对科学家是必要的，但它必须和证据一起用。
科学需要严谨，需要数据和实验。但如果没有想象力，就很难提出新问题，也很难想到新的解释。
比如科学家可能先大胆猜一个可能原因，然后再设计实验去验证。如果没有这个“先猜一下”，很多时候都不知道从哪开始查。
所以想象力负责开新路，证据负责把关，保证结论靠谱。两个都需要。

- What kinds of jobs need imagination?
> Many jobs need imagination, not only art jobs. Any job that needs new ideas or new solutions needs it.
For example, designers and content creators need to come up with fresh ideas all the time. Another example is product or marketing work. People often face new problems, and they need to think of a plan.
If a job has no clear answer, imagination becomes more important. It helps you try new ways and find what works.
With imagination, you can stand out and solve problems better. Without it, you may just copy others, and your work feels replaceable.
我觉得很多工作都需要想象力，不只是艺术类。只要工作需要新点子、新办法，就离不开想象力。
比如设计师、内容创作者要一直想新创意；还有产品或营销，经常遇到新情况，你得想方案、想活动。
一般来说，越是没有标准答案、变化越多的工作，就越需要想象力去“试路子”，看看什么能行。
有想象力的人更容易做出差异，也更会解决问题；但如果只会照搬，就很容易显得可替代。

- What subjects are helpful for children's imagination?
> I think subjects that encourage creating and expressing ideas are the most helpful for imagination.
Art and writing are obvious examples. Kids can draw what they imagine, and they can make up stories. They don’t need one “correct” answer.
But science can also help. In a good science class, children ask “what if” questions. They make a guess first, and then they test it with a simple experiment.
These subjects train kids to think in different ways. They also make kids more confident about sharing ideas.
我觉得最能帮助想象力的学科，通常不是那种靠死背的，而是会逼孩子去创造、去表达的。
美术和写作就很典型。孩子可以把脑子里的画面画出来，也可以编故事，而且不一定只有一个“标准答案”。
但科学课也能帮想象力，前提是上得好。孩子会问很多“如果……会怎样”的问题，先猜一下，再用小实验去验证。
这些学科会训练孩子用不同方式思考，也会让他们更敢表达自己的想法。

- What games help develop children's imagination?
> Games that develop imagination are usually open-ended. There isn’t just one correct way to play.
In these games, kids create their own stories and rules. They have to think creatively, and they also learn to express ideas.
Two great types are role-play and building games. Role-play lets children pretend and act out different characters. Building games like blocks or LEGO let them design and invent things.
The key is giving them space. Adults shouldn’t control every step. If kids can explore freely, their imagination grows faster.
我觉得最能培养孩子想象力的，是那种开放式游戏，没有唯一正确答案。
在这种游戏里，孩子会自己编故事、自己定规则。这样他们就会更会创造，也更会表达想法。
我觉得最典型的两类就是角色扮演和搭建类。角色扮演比如过家家，孩子会自己设定人物和情节。搭建类比如积木或乐高，他们会设计、拼出自己脑子里的东西。
关键还是给空间，别每一步都指挥。孩子能自由探索的话，想象力会长得更快。

- How important is imagination to children?
> I think imagination is very important for children. It’s not just about having fun.
It helps them learn better. When kids can imagine, they understand stories and pictures more easily. It also helps with problem-solving, because they can think of different ways to do things.
With imagination, children are usually more confident to express themselves. They also try new things more willingly, so they adapt faster.
So I think we should protect it. Give kids time to play and explore. Don’t interrupt too much, and don’t force one “right answer” all the time.
我觉得想象力对孩子非常重要，它不只是“会玩”这么简单。
它会让孩子学得更顺，比如理解故事、图画会更快。它也能帮孩子解决问题，因为孩子能想到不同的做法，不会只卡在一种思路里。
有想象力的孩子通常更敢表达，也更愿意尝试新东西，所以适应变化会更快。
所以我觉得我们应该保护孩子的想象力。给他们时间去玩、去探索，别老打断，也别总逼他们找唯一正确答案。

### 自行车/摩托车/汽车旅行
- Describe a bicycle/motorcycle/car trip you would like to go.
  You should say:
  Who you would like to go with?
  Where you would like to go?
  When you would like to go?
  And explain why you would like to go by bicycle/motorcycle/car?
> Well, if I had to pick a trip I'd love to go on, it would definitely be a self-driving tour across the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. I mean, the idea of exploring such vast natural beauty at my own pace is incredibly appealing. Specifically, I envision driving the Hulunbuir Grassland loop. This route is renowned for its breathtaking scenery, offering endless stretches of green, clear skies, and a chance to experience the unique nomadic culture. The highlight of this dream trip would be encountering natural phenomena like the aurora borealis or the Perseid meteor shower. Imagine parking the car in the middle of nowhere, far from city lights, and witnessing such celestial displays. That would be absolutely unforgettable. Ultimately, the special significance of this trip for me lies in experiencing the sheer grandeur of nature. It's about disconnecting from the hustle and bustle of daily life and reconnecting with the raw, untamed beauty of our planet. It promises to be a deeply rejuvenating and inspiring journey.
> 好吧,如果要我选择一个我想去的旅行,那绝对是穿越蒙古草原的自驾游。我的意思是,按照我自己的节奏探索如此广阔的自然美景的想法非常有吸引力。具体来说,我设想驾驶呼伦贝尔草原环线。这条路线以其令人惊叹的风景而闻名,提供无尽的绿色、清澈的天空,以及体验独特的游牧文化的机会。这次梦想之旅的亮点是遇到北极光或英仙座流星雨等自然现象。想象一下,将车停在远离城市灯光的荒郊野外,并目睹这样的天体表演。那绝对是难忘的。归根结底,这次旅行对我来说的特殊意义在于体验大自然的壮丽。这是关于摆脱日常生活的喧器,重新与我们星球原始、未驯服的美丽建立联系。这将是一次充满活力和鼓舞人心的旅程。

- Which form of vehicle is more popular in your country, bikes, cars or motorcycles?
> In China, I’d say cars are the most popular overall. Many families have one, and it’s the main choice for long trips and family travel.
But in big cities, bikes and motorcycles are also very common. They are cheaper, and they are easier to park. They’re great for short distances and the “last mile”.
For example, people may drive to work if they live far away. But they might use a shared bike or an e-bike to get from the subway to home.
So it depends on the situation. Cars are more popular in general, but two-wheel vehicles are very practical in cities.
在中国，我觉得总体上还是汽车更普遍。很多家庭都有一辆，跑长距离或者全家出行基本还是靠它。
但在大城市里，自行车和摩托车（包括电动车）也很常见。它们更便宜，也更好停车，短距离和“最后一公里”特别方便。
比如住得远的人可能会开车通勤；但从地铁到家这段路，很多人会骑共享单车或者电动车。
所以还是得看场景。整体汽车更主流，但在城市里两轮车确实更实用。

- Do you think air pollution comes mostly from mobile vehicles?
> Not mostly, in my opinion. Vehicles are a big part, especially in cities, but they are not the only source.
In busy urban areas, exhaust is easy to notice. You can smell it near main roads, and it gets worse during rush hour. So people naturally think cars are the main cause.
But air pollution also comes from factories, power plants, and even construction dust. In some places, these sources may be bigger than vehicles.
So I think we need a mixed solution. We should control industrial pollution, and we should also reduce traffic pollution by using public transport and cleaner cars.
我觉得不完全是。车辆确实是重要来源之一，尤其在城市里，但它不是唯一来源。
在大城市车多，尾气特别明显。你在主干道旁边能闻到味道，早晚高峰更严重，所以大家会觉得“车就是主要原因”。
但空气污染也来自工厂、发电厂，甚至还有施工扬尘。在一些地方，这些可能比车辆更关键。
所以我觉得解决办法也得是组合拳：工业污染要管，同时也要通过公共交通和更清洁的汽车来降低交通污染。

- Do you think people need to change the way of transportation drastically to protect the environment?
> Yes, people need to change how they travel, but it doesn’t need to be drastic.
Most people still need transport every day. They go to work and they take care of family things. So we need realistic options, not just rules.
For example, for short trips, people can walk or ride a bike. For longer trips, they can use buses or the subway more often.
If the new options are easy, people will follow them. Then pollution can go down. If it feels too hard, people will complain and give up.
我觉得需要改，但不一定要“剧烈改变”。
大多数人每天都离不开出行，要上班，也要处理家里的事情。所以得先给可行的替代方案，而不是只喊口号。
比如短距离能走路就走路，或者骑车；远一点就更常用公交和地铁。
如果替代方案够方便，大家就愿意跟着做，污染也会降；但如果太难执行，人就只会抱怨，最后坚持不下去。

- How are the transportation systems in urban areas and rural areas different?
> Urban transport is usually more convenient. Rural transport is often more limited.
In cities, people live close together, so public transport works well. There are more bus lines, and they come more often. Many cities also have subways, so it’s easy to travel without a car.
In rural areas, people live farther apart. It’s hard to run many bus routes, and buses may come only a few times a day. So people often rely on their own vehicles.
For example, in cities, people can use the subway and shared bikes. In the countryside, many people use cars or motorcycles to get around.
So the big difference is choice. Cities offer more options, while rural areas depend more on personal transport.
城市交通一般更方便；农村交通通常更有限。
城市里人住得密，所以公共交通更好做。公交线路多，班次也更密。很多城市还有地铁，不开车也能出行。
农村地区人住得分散，距离也更远。公交线路不好铺，而且车可能一天就几趟，所以大家更依赖自己的交通工具。
比如城市里可以坐地铁、骑共享单车；但在乡下，很多人更常用私家车或摩托车出行。
所以差别核心就是“选择”。城市选择多，农村更靠个人交通。

- Why do more people own and drive private cars now?
> I think more people own and drive private cars mainly because it’s more convenient. Lifestyle has changed too.
A car gives you more flexibility, and it can save time, especially for commuting. It’s also more comfortable, and you don’t have to deal with bad weather as much.
Cars are also more affordable now for many families. Cities have expanded as well, so people often live farther from work.
For example, it’s easier to take your family out on weekends if you have a car. And on rainy days, driving feels much less hassle.
我觉得现在私家车变多，主要还是因为更方便，而且生活方式也变了。
有车出行更灵活，通勤也更省时间。舒适度也更高，遇到天气不好时尤其明显。
另外很多家庭收入提高了，买车也更容易了。城市变大以后，很多人住得离公司更远，更需要车。
比如周末带家人出去玩，有车会方便很多。下雨天通勤开车也更省事。

- What do you think of the future of electric cars?
> I’m quite positive about the future of electric cars. I think they will become more common, but it won’t happen overnight.
They have clear advantages. They’re quieter, and the running cost can be lower. But there are still limits. Charging is not equally convenient everywhere, and people worry about battery life and resale value.
So in big cities, electric cars will likely grow faster. They fit daily commuting well. In rural areas or for long trips, petrol cars may still stay for a while.
Overall, the trend is clear. Electric cars will take a bigger share. Better charging networks and better batteries will speed it up.
我对电动车的未来总体是看好的，我觉得会越来越普及，但不会一下子就完全替代油车。
它的优势很明显：更安静，用车成本也可能更低。但限制也还在，比如充电并不是哪里都方便，很多人也会担心电池寿命和二手保值。
所以大城市里电动车可能发展更快，因为很适合日常通勤。偏远地区或者经常跑长途的人，短期内可能还是离不开油车。
总的来说趋势很清楚：电动车占比会持续上升。充电网络和电池技术越成熟，推进就越快。

### 不享受的音乐活动
- Describe an event you attended in which you didn’t enjoy the music played.
  You should say:
  What it was?
  Who you went with?
  Why you decided to go there?
  And explain why you didn’t enjoy it?
> Well, let me tell you about a music event that was, to put it mildly, quite a letdown for me. It was a classical music concert I attended a few years ago, hoping for an evening of sublime melodies and masterful performances. However, the reality was starkly different. From the very beginning, the orchestra seemed out of sync, and the lead violinist made several noticeable mistakes. There were moments of hesitant playing and even some off-key notes, which was particularly jarring for a classical performance. Despite the growing discomfort and disappointment among the audience, I, along with most others, stayed until the very end. I kept hoping it would improve, or perhaps that the next piece would redeem the evening, but unfortunately, it never really did. I left the concert feeling profoundly disappointed. I mean, I appreciate the effort, but the performance quality was simply not up to standard. It was a wasted evening and definitely not the uplifting experience I had anticipated from a classical music event.
> 好吧,让我告诉你一个音乐活动,说得委婉些,对我来说是相当失望的。那是几年前我参加的一个古典音乐会,我希望有一个美妙的旋律和精湛的表演的夜晚。然而,现实却完全不同。从一开始,管弦乐队似乎就不协调,首席小提琴手犯了几个明显的错误。有犹豫的演奏,甚至一些走调的音符,这是特别不和谐的古典表演的时刻。尽管观众越来越不舒服和失望,我和大多数人一样,一直呆到最后。我一直希望它会有所改善,或者下一首曲子会弥补这个夜晚,但不幸的是,它从来没有真正做到。音乐会结束后,我感到非常失望。我是说,我很欣赏你的努力,但表演质量根本达不到标准。这是一个浪费的夜晚,绝对不是我在古典音乐活动中所期待的令人振奋的体验。

- What kind of music events do people like today?
> People today often like music events that feel lively and interactive. They don’t only go to hear songs. They go for the atmosphere.
One reason is that people want to relax and hang out at the same time. Also, short videos are everywhere now, so people like events that look good on camera.
For example, concerts and music festivals are very popular. Everyone sings along and the lights look amazing. Livehouse shows are popular too, because you’re closer to the singer and it feels more personal.
So these events are more than just music. They’re a full experience, and that’s why people prefer going in person.
我觉得现在大家更喜欢那种热闹、能互动的音乐活动。大家不只是去听歌，更是去感受现场氛围。
一个原因是大家想放松一下，同时也想跟朋友一起玩。再加上短视频太普遍了，很多人会更喜欢那种拍出来好看、发出去也有内容的现场。
比如演唱会和音乐节很受欢迎，大家一起跟唱，灯光也很震撼。还有 livehouse 也很火，因为离歌手更近，互动更直接。
所以这些活动不只是音乐而已，而是一种完整体验。这就是很多人更愿意去现场的原因。

- Do you think children should receive some musical education?
> Yes, I think children should receive some musical education. It doesn’t have to be super serious.
For example, they can learn basic rhythm and simple music theory. They can also join group activities like choir or percussion, because it feels fun and social.
Music training can improve focus and patience. It also helps kids express emotions in a healthy way. And group music teaches teamwork, because everyone has to follow the same beat.
So I don’t think every child needs to master an instrument. The goal is to let them enjoy music and make it part of life.
我觉得应该让孩子接受一些音乐教育，但别搞得太功利，先让孩子接触并且喜欢上更重要。
比如学一点基础乐理和节奏训练就很够用了。也可以参加合唱或者打击乐这种集体活动，因为更有趣，也更有参与感。
音乐训练能提升专注和耐心，也能帮孩子用更健康的方式表达情绪。集体音乐还会让孩子更会合作，因为大家要跟同一个节奏走。
所以我不觉得每个孩子都要把乐器练到很专业。让音乐变成一种日常习惯，其实就已经很不错了。

- What are the differences between old and young people’s music preferences?
> I think the differences are pretty clear. Older people often prefer familiar songs and strong melodies. Younger people are usually more open to new styles.
Many older listeners care a lot about lyrics and meaning. They like songs that bring back memories, so classic songs feel safe and comfortable. Young people often chase new trends and fast beats. They’re more willing to try different genres.
But it’s not always about age. If we judge only by age, it can be unfair. Some older people love electronic music, and some young people love old classics.
So age does influence music taste, but personal experience matters more. In the end, people just listen to what feels good to them.
我觉得差别挺明显的，主要在“熟悉感”和“节奏偏好”。
年长的人往往更看重旋律和歌词，也更喜欢熟悉的老歌，因为会带回忆，听起来更踏实、更舒服。年轻人通常更爱追新，节奏也更快一点，更愿意去尝试不同风格。
但如果只按年龄一刀切，也不准确。也有老人很爱电音，也有年轻人特别爱经典老歌。
所以年龄确实会影响音乐偏好，但个人经历更关键。最后大家还是听让自己舒服、听着顺的音乐。

- What kind of music events are there in your country?
> In my country, there are quite a few music events. The most common ones are large live shows.
Concerts are very popular, especially for big singers on tour. Music festivals are popular too, and they often have multiple stages and different genres.
Big cities usually have more options. The venues are also more professional. These days, events focus more on the whole experience, like stage visuals and audience interaction.
Overall, people have more choices than before. It’s easier to find something you enjoy. And more people are willing to pay for that live atmosphere.
在我国家，音乐活动其实挺多的，但最主流的还是那种大型现场。
比如大型演唱会很常见，很多歌手会做巡演。还有户外音乐节也很火，一般是多舞台、多风格，大家可以自由挑自己喜欢的。
一线城市的选择会更多，场馆也更专业。这几年活动也更重“体验感”，比如舞美灯光和互动环节都会做得更强。
总体来说，大家能选的更多了，也更容易找到合自己口味的活动。很多人也愿意为了现场氛围花这笔钱。

- Why do many people like listening to music while doing sports?
> Many people like listening to music while doing sports because it helps with rhythm. It makes the workout feel easier to keep going.
That said, it doesn’t fit every sport. For something like yoga, people may prefer quiet. They need to focus on breathing and movement.
For example, when you run, a strong beat helps you keep your pace. In the gym, music can pump you up during strength training.
So music can boost mood and focus. It makes exercise feel more enjoyable. And that’s why people are more likely to stick with it.
我觉得很多人运动时爱听音乐，主要是因为音乐能带节奏，让人更容易坚持下去。
当然也不是所有运动都适合听歌，比如瑜伽这种需要专注呼吸和动作的，可能安静一点更舒服。
比如跑步时听节奏强的歌，会更容易稳住配速。健身做力量训练时，音乐也能把人“顶起来”，更有劲。
所以音乐能提升情绪和专注，让运动体验更爽，也更容易把运动变成习惯。

- What are the differences between listening to music at home and at a live concert?
> To me, the main difference is the overall experience. A live concert feels more immersive, while listening at home feels more controlled and comfortable.
At a concert, the sound, the lights, and the crowd interaction create a strong atmosphere. It’s easier to get emotional and feel connected. At home, you can choose any song, pause anytime, and keep it quiet. It feels private and relaxing.
If you only listen at home, you miss that shared energy. You also miss that “wow” moment that stays with you.
So I think they fit different needs. Go to a concert for the big experience. Listen at home when you just want to relax.
我觉得核心差别就是整体体验。现场更沉浸，在家更可控、更舒服。
演唱会现场有音响、灯光，还有人群的互动，所以氛围很强，情绪也更容易被带动。在家听歌就更自在，你想听什么就听什么，想暂停就暂停，音量也能开得很小，会更私密、更放松。
如果你只在家听，其实会少一种共同氛围，也少那种“被震撼一下”的感觉，所以记忆点没那么强。
所以两种方式满足的需求不一样：想要强烈体验就去现场；想要自在放松就在家听。

### 朋友学的技能
- Describe one of your friends who learned something without a teacher.
  You should say:
  Who he/she is?
  What he/she learned?
  Why he/she learned this?
  And explain whether it would be easier to learn from a teacher?
> Well, I'd like to talk about one of my university roommates, Noble, who's not just a friend but also someone I deeply admire for his unique hobbies and dedication. He's always been the kind of person who dives deep into his interests, and that's exactly what he did with this particular skill. The skill he picked up is amateur radio communication, often known as 'ham radio'. It's essentially about using various radio frequency bands to communicate globally, which sounds quite technical, but Noble made it fascinating. He learned it from an older, experienced ham radio operator he met through an online forum, not in a formal classroom setting. The core story behind his learning journey is quite remarkable. He spent months meticulously building his own Yagi antenna from scratch, which is a directional antenna. Then, he managed to make contact with a Japanese friend through a repeater on the International Space Station. Imagine the thrill of that! It wasn't just about talking; it was about overcoming technical challenges and connecting across vast distances using self-made equipment. This skill has had a profound impact on him. It not only honed his technical problem-solving abilities but also broadened his perspective on global communication and cultural exchange. He's become more patient, detail-oriented, and has even inspired others, including myself, to explore unconventional hobbies. It's truly shaped who he is today, making him a more well-rounded and interesting individual.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我的大学室友之一Noble,他不仅是我的朋友,而且也是我深深钦佩的人,因为他独特的爱好和奉献精神。他一直是那种深入研究自己兴趣的人,而这正是他运用这种特殊技能所做的。他学到的技能是业余无线电通信,通常被称为“业余无线电”。它本质上是关于使用各种无线电频段在全球范围内进行通信,这听起来很技术,但Noble让它变得迷人。他从一位年长、经验丰富的业余无线电操作员那里学到了这一点,他是通过在线论坛而不是在正式的课堂环境中认识的。他的学习之旅背后的核心故事相当非凡。他花了几个月的时间从头开始精心建造自己的八木天线,这是一种定向天线。然后,他设法通过国际空间站上的转发器与一位日本朋友取得了联系。想象一下那有多刺激!这不仅仅是谈论;这是关于克服技术挑战并使用自制设备进行远距离连接。这项技能对他影响深远。这不仅磨练了他解决技术问题的能力,也拓宽了他对全球沟通和文化交流的视野。他变得更加有耐心、注重细节,甚至激励包括我自己在内的其他人去探索非常规的爱好。这确实塑造了今天的他,使他成为一个更加全面、有趣的人。

- Is it necessary to keep learning after graduating from school?
> Yes, I think it’s necessary. Graduating from school doesn’t mean you’re done learning.
Work changes really fast these days. New tools and new ways of doing things come out all the time. If you stop learning, it’s easy to fall behind.
And it’s not only about work. Life skills matter too. Things like managing money, staying healthy, or communicating better can make your daily life easier.
So I’d say lifelong learning is important. You don’t have to go back to school. You can just learn a little bit regularly.
我觉得很有必要。毕业并不代表“学习结束”了。
现在工作变化很快，新工具、新方法一直在出现。如果你完全不学，很容易就跟不上。
而且学习也不只是为了工作。很多生活技能也需要学，比如理财、健康管理、沟通表达，这些会让日子过得更顺。
所以我觉得毕业后持续学习很重要。你不一定要回学校，平时稳定地学一点就可以了。

- Should teachers make learning in their classes fun?
> Yes, I think teachers should make classes fun to a certain degree. When lessons are enjoyable, students pay more attention. They also feel less stressed.
That said, “fun” shouldn’t mean just playing games all the time. A class still needs clear goals. It also needs a good pace.
If teachers only chase fun, the content can become too shallow. Students may remember the jokes, but they forget the key points. That’s a waste of time.
So the best approach is “fun and useful.” Keep students engaged, and make sure they actually learn something.
我觉得老师应该让课堂在一定程度上更有趣。课好玩一点，学生更容易专注，也没那么紧张。
但我也想说，“有趣”不等于一直做游戏。课堂还是要有目标，也要有节奏。
如果老师只追求好玩，内容就可能变浅。学生可能只记得老师很逗，但知识点没留下来，那就很亏。
所以更好的做法是“有趣且有效”。让学生愿意学，同时也真的学到东西。

- Do you think there are too many subjects for students to learn?
> Yes, in many cases. Students have to learn too many subjects, especially in middle and high school.
If schools keep adding subjects, students’ time gets split up. They can’t go deep in any one subject, so learning becomes shallow.
I’m not saying we should drop the basics. But schools can make more subjects optional and cut repeated homework. That helps students focus on what matters.
In the end, fewer subjects with better learning can work. Students feel less stressed, and they understand things more clearly.
我觉得很多情况下确实有点多，尤其是中学阶段。
如果学校一直加科目，学生的时间就会被切碎，每门都学不深，学习就容易变浅。
我也不是说基础科目要砍掉，但其他科目可以更灵活一点，比如更多选修、模块化。作业也可以少一些重复，让学生把精力放在真正重要的内容上。
总的来说，科目少一点但学得更扎实会更合理。学生压力更低，理解也会更清楚。

- Is it better to focus on a few subjects or to learn many subjects?
> I’d say it’s better to focus on a few subjects, especially when you’re trying to build real skills. If you spread yourself too thin, you only touch the surface.
For example, if someone wants to go into engineering or coding, it helps to go deep in math, logic, and English. These subjects support almost everything else.
That said, learning many subjects also has value. It can help you find what you actually like, and it makes you more well-rounded.
So I think the best plan is balance. Learn a bit broadly at first, then narrow down later. You end up with both direction and strength.
我更偏向少而精，尤其是你想真正把能力练出来的时候。科目太多会摊薄精力，容易每门都只学个皮毛。
比如你想走理工或者编程方向，那数学、逻辑和英语就应该先学深一点，因为这些是很多能力的底层支撑。
但我也承认，多学一些科目也有意义。它能帮你更快发现自己喜欢什么，也能让你跟不同领域的人更好沟通。
所以我觉得最理想的是平衡：前期学得广一点，后期再收得窄一点。这样既不容易迷茫，也更容易形成核心竞争力。

- Do you think enterprises should provide training for their employees?
> Yes, I think enterprises should provide training. It’s a win-win.
For example, onboarding training helps new staff get up to speed faster. Training on new tools or systems also matters. It reduces mistakes and improves efficiency.
In the long run, better skills mean better results for the company. It also helps employees feel supported, so they’re more likely to stay.
So training doesn’t have to be fancy or expensive. Keep it practical, and do it regularly.
我觉得企业应该给员工提供培训，这其实是双赢。
比如新员工的入职培训，能让他们更快上手。再比如公司引入新工具、新系统的时候，配套培训能减少错误，提高效率。
长期来看，员工能力上去了，公司产出更稳定。员工也会觉得公司在支持自己，就更愿意留下来，流失率也会更低。
所以培训不一定要搞得很花哨、很烧钱。实用一点、持续一点就够了。

- Do you think it is good for older adults to continue learning?
> Yes, I think it’s really good for older adults to keep learning. It keeps their mind active, and it gives them a sense of progress.
It’s also very practical. Many daily tasks are digital now, like using a smartphone, shopping online, or booking a doctor’s appointment. If they learn these skills, life becomes much easier.
In the long run, learning helps them stay independent. It also boosts confidence, because they don’t have to rely on others for everything. And they can keep up in conversations with family and friends.
So I’d say it’s worth it. They don’t need to learn anything too hard. Just pick something useful and take it step by step.
我觉得这很好，老年人继续学习非常值得。
一方面，学习能让大脑保持活跃，不至于越老越“退”。另一方面也很实用，现在很多事情都数字化了，比如用智能手机、网购、线上挂号。如果学会这些，生活会方便很多。
长期来看，继续学习会让他们更独立、更有自信，不用什么都依赖别人。跟家人朋友聊天也不容易脱节。
所以我觉得很值得。他们不需要学很难的东西，选自己用得上的，慢慢来就行。

### 机智解决问题的人
- Describe a person who solved a problem in a smart way.
  You should say:
  Who this person is?
  What the problem was?
  How he/she solved it?
  And explain why you think he/she did it in a smart way?
> Well, I'd like to talk about my friend, Alex, who is an incredibly resourceful person. He's genuinely one of the most creative and out-of-the-box thinkers I know, always approaching challenges with a fresh perspective. A few months ago, I was really struggling with a complex data analysis project at work. I had spent days trying to figure out how to streamline the process, but everything I tried seemed to hit a dead end. I was feeling quite overwhelmed and frustrated, to be honest. That's when Alex stepped in. He wasn't even in my department, but he overheard me venting about it during a coffee break. He offered to take a look, and I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking it was too specialized for him. But he insisted, saying he loved a good puzzle. What he did was truly brilliant. Instead of focusing on the existing software, he suggested a completely different approach using a combination of open-source tools and a custom script he wrote on the spot. It was something I hadn't even considered. His solution not only automated a significant portion of the work, saving me countless hours, but also provided more accurate results than my initial method. I was absolutely blown away by his ingenuity. His ability to connect seemingly unrelated concepts and devise such an elegant solution was incredibly inspiring. It really taught me to look beyond conventional methods and embrace creative problem-solving.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我的朋友亚历克斯,他是一个非常足智多谋的人。他确实是我认识的最有创造力、最跳出框框的思想家之一,总是以新的视角应对挑战。几个月前,我在工作中为一个复杂的数据分析项目而苦苦挣扎。我花了几天时间试图弄清楚如何简化流程,但我尝试的一切似乎都陷入了死胡同。说实话,我感到非常不知所措和沮丧。就在那时,亚历克斯介入了。他甚至不在我的部门,但他无意中听到我在喝咖啡休息时发泄这件事。他主动提出要看看,我一开始有点怀疑,认为这对他来说太专业了。但他坚持说,他喜欢好的拼图。他所做的确实非常出色。他没有专注于现有的软件,而是建议了一种完全不同的方法,使用开源工具和他当场编写的自定义脚本的组合。这是我甚至没有考虑过的事情。他的解决方案不仅自动化了很大一部分工作,为我节省了无数时间,而且还提供了比我最初的方法更准确的结果。我完全被他的聪明才智所震撼。他将看似不相关的概念联系起来并设计出如此优雅的解决方案的能力令人难以置信地鼓舞人心。它确实教会了我超越传统方法并拥抱创造性的解决问题。

- Do you think children are born smart or they learn to become smart?
> I think it’s both, but learning matters more. Some kids are naturally quicker, and that’s real. But it’s not the whole story.
If a child only relies on talent, they can stop improving. Then they get passed very fast.
For example, some kids learn quickly at the start. They feel confident, so they don’t practice much later. On the other hand, some kids are not fast at first. But they keep practicing and asking questions, so they improve a lot.
So I think “smart” is mostly built. Kids become smarter through habits, effort, and good support.
我觉得两者都有，但更关键的还是后天学习。有些孩子确实天生反应快，这没问题，但这不是全部。
如果一个孩子只靠天赋，他很容易就不继续努力了，然后进步就停住了，很快就会被别人追上。
比如有的孩子一开始学得快，就觉得自己很行，后面反而不怎么练；但也有些孩子起步没那么快，却一直练、一直提问，最后进步更明显。
所以我更倾向于：所谓聪明大多是“练出来的”。习惯、努力和环境支持，才是真正拉开差距的东西。

- How do children become smart at school?
> Children become smart at school mainly by building good learning habits. It’s not only about listening to the teacher.
A smart student knows how to learn. They ask questions when they don’t understand. They also review and fix mistakes. Feedback from teachers and classmates helps a lot.
For example, some students keep a mistake notebook. They write down what went wrong and how to do it next time. Another example is group discussion. When you explain your idea to others, you understand it better.
Over time, learning becomes easier. Kids improve faster, and they feel more confident.
我觉得孩子在学校变聪明，主要靠养成好的学习习惯，而不只是“坐着听老师讲”。
真正聪明的学生往往更会学习：不懂就问，会复习，也会改错。老师和同学的反馈也很关键，会让进步变快。
比如有些学生会做错题本，把哪里错了、下次怎么做写清楚；或者通过小组讨论把思路讲出来，你一讲就更清楚了。
时间久了，学习会变得更轻松，进步也更快，孩子也更自信。

- Why are some people well-rounded and others only good at one thing?
> I think a big reason is the reward system. People often become what their environment pushes them to be.
If a school or family praises many different skills, children try more things. They join activities, learn basic skills, and become more well-rounded. But if the system only cares about one score or one talent, people focus on that one thing. They spend most of their time there.
Of course, personality matters too. Some people are naturally curious. Others like to go deep.
So it’s really about where time goes. Wide practice builds a wide skill set. Long focus builds one strong skill.
我觉得很大一个原因是“奖励机制”。环境夸什么、奖励什么，人就会往哪儿用力。
如果学校或家庭更认可多种能力，孩子就更愿意去尝试，参加活动、练基础，慢慢就更全面。可如果系统只看一个分数或一个特长，人就会把大部分时间都投在那一件事上。
当然性格也有影响。有的人天生好奇，什么都想试；也有人就喜欢钻深，把一件事做透。
所以本质还是时间流向。时间分得广，能力面就更宽；时间集中砸一处，单点就会更强。

- Why does modern society need talents of all kinds?
> Modern society needs all kinds of talents because life is more complex now. One type of skill can’t solve everything.
We rely on teamwork and specialization. Different jobs support each other. If one part is missing, the whole system slows down.
For example, to build an app, you need programmers. You also need designers. Another example is running a big event. You need someone to plan it, and you need people to execute it.
So having many different talents makes society stronger. It also makes innovation faster, because ideas come from different angles.
现代社会需要各种各样的人才，因为现在的生活和问题都更复杂了，靠一种能力解决不了所有事。
我们其实是靠分工合作在运转。不同岗位互相支撑，少了任何一环，整个系统都会慢下来。
比如做一个App，需要程序员，也需要设计师；再比如办一场大型活动，需要人策划，也需要人执行。
所以人才越多样，社会运转越稳，也更容易创新，因为不同的人会从不同角度带来想法。

- Do you think smart children are happier than other children?
> Not necessarily. Smart children aren’t automatically happier.
If being smart always meant being happy, life would be easier for them. But in real life, they often face higher expectations. That can create more pressure.
Happiness usually comes from support and relationships. A warm family and good friends matter a lot. Smart kids can also overthink. They may worry more than others.
So intelligence is a benefit, but it’s not the key. A balanced life and emotional support are what really make children happier.
我觉得不一定，聪明并不自动等于更快乐。
如果聪明就一定更快乐，那他们应该更轻松。但现实里聪明的孩子往往被期待更多，所以压力也更大。
而快乐更多来自支持系统，比如家庭氛围和朋友关系。聪明的孩子也可能更容易想太多，所以更容易焦虑。
所以智力是一种优势，但不是决定因素。真正影响幸福感的，还是平衡的生活和情绪支持。

- Is it important for schools to identify and develop each student's talents?
> Yes, I think it’s important for schools to identify and develop each student’s talents. School shouldn’t only focus on exam scores.
When a student’s talent is noticed, they feel more motivated. They also gain confidence, and learning feels less painful.
Schools can do this in practical ways. They can offer more electives and clubs. Teachers can also give specific feedback and real chances, like projects or competitions.
For example, students who are good at speaking can try debating or hosting. Students who are good with hands-on work can join robotics or lab projects.
我觉得很重要，学校不应该只盯着分数。
当一个学生的天赋被看见，他会更有动力，自信也会更强，学习也不那么痛苦。
学校其实可以用很实际的方式去做，比如多一些选修课和社团。老师也可以给更具体的反馈和机会，比如做项目、参加比赛。
比如表达能力强的学生可以去辩论或做主持。动手能力强的学生可以做机器人或者实验类项目。

### 对家庭重要的东西
- Describe something important that has been kept in your family for a long time.
  You should say:
  What it is?
  When your family had it?
  How your family got it?
  And explain why it is important to your family?
> Well, an important item that has been kept in my family for a long time is actually my grandfather's third-class merit medal. It's something we all cherish deeply. This medal is quite special, you know, not just because of its age, but also due to the intricate patterns engraved on it. It depicts a soldier standing firm, with a star above, symbolizing honor and bravery. The story behind this medal is truly inspiring. My grandfather, who served as a military doctor, earned it for his selfless dedication in saving lives during a border defense battle. He worked tirelessly, often under extremely dangerous conditions, to tend to the wounded. For me, this medal holds immense emotional value. It constantly reminds me of his courage and resilience, and it motivates me to strive for excellence in my own life, whatever challenges I may face. It's a symbol of our family's heritage and a source of great pride.
> 嗯,家里长期保存的一件重要物品实际上就是我祖父的三等功奖章。这是我们都深深珍惜的东西。你知道,这枚奖章相当特别,不仅是因为它的年代,还因为上面雕刻着错综复杂的图案。它描绘了一名士兵站稳脚跟,上面有一颗星星,象征着荣誉和勇敢。这枚奖牌背后的故事确实令人鼓舞。我的祖父曾担任军医,他因在边防战斗中无私奉献拯救生命而赢得这一荣誉。他不知疲倦地工作,通常是在极其危险的条件下,照顾伤员。对我来说,这枚奖牌具有巨大的情感价值。它不断提醒我他的勇气和韧性,它激励我在自己的生活中追求卓越,无论我面临什么挑战。它是我们家族遗产的象征,也是我们巨大自豪的源泉。

- What things do families keep for a long time?
> Usually, families keep things for a long time because they mean something. It’s not always about money.
A big one is memory stuff. For example, old photos are hard to throw away. They remind people of family members and old times.
Another type is “still useful” stuff. For example, some families keep old furniture because it still works. They also feel it’s a waste to replace it.
Over time, these things become part of the home. They carry stories. But honestly, they can also pile up, and that makes cleaning harder.
一般来说，家里能留很久的东西，大多不是因为贵，而是因为“有意义”，丢不下。
最常见的一类是纪念类。比如老照片真的很难扔，因为它会让人想到家里人和以前的日子。
另一类就是“还能用”的东西。比如一些老家具虽然旧，但还好用，换掉反而觉得浪费。
时间久了，这些东西就变成家的一部分了，像是带着故事。但说实话，也可能越堆越多，最后清理起来更难。

- What’s the difference between things valued by people in the past and today?
> Honestly, people in the past cared more about survival and stability. They wanted things that could “hold up” in real life.
Life was less certain, so they valued saving and durability. If something could last for years, that was a big deal.
Today, many people still care about money. But they care more about comfort and experience too. They ask, “Does this make my life easier?” and “Do I actually enjoy it?”
For example, in the past people might keep one appliance for ten years. Now some people pay for services like delivery because it saves time.
So the values feel more personal today. That’s nice, but it also makes people compare more and overthink.
说实话，过去的人更在意“能不能活得稳、扛不扛得住”。他们更想要那种能在现实里顶得住的东西。
因为日子不确定感更强，所以大家更重视存钱和耐用。一个东西能用很多年，在当时就很值。
现在的人当然也在乎钱，但也更在乎舒服和体验。大家会问：“这能不能让生活更省事？”“我到底喜不喜欢？”
比如以前一个家电用十年很正常；现在有些人愿意花钱买配送服务，因为省时间。
所以现在的价值标准更个人化了。这挺爽的，但也更容易让人比较、纠结。

- What kinds of things are kept in museums?
> Museums usually keep things that tell a story about the past. They don’t have to be expensive, but they need to be meaningful.
A lot of museums keep historical objects. These can be old tools, pottery, paintings, or traditional clothes.
Museums also keep records. They may collect old photos, letters, or documents, because these show how people lived and what happened in history.
For example, you might see ancient objects like pottery or calligraphy. You can also see things like war-time letters or old photos. They help people understand the past in a clearer way.
博物馆一般收藏的是能讲出“过去故事”的东西，不一定多贵，但一定得有意义。
很多博物馆会收藏历史物件，比如旧工具、陶器、画作，或者传统服饰。
它们也会收藏一些记录类的东西，比如老照片、信件、文件，因为这些能反映当时的人怎么生活、发生过什么。
比如你可能会看到古代的陶器或书法作品，也可能看到战争时期的信件或老照片。这些东西能让人更清楚地理解过去。

- What’s the influence of technology on museums?
> Technology has changed museums a lot. It helps people understand exhibitions more easily. It also makes museums more interesting.
Many museums now use simple tools like apps and audio guides. Visitors can scan a code and listen to an explanation. Some museums also use AR or VR. It can show how something looked in the past.
Technology also makes museums easier to visit from far away. Museums can put exhibitions online. People can watch videos or take an online tour at home.
But there is a small downside. Some visitors focus too much on taking photos. They don’t spend enough time really looking at the objects.
科技对博物馆的影响很大。它能帮助人更容易看懂展览，也能让博物馆变得更有意思。
现在很多博物馆都会用一些简单工具，比如App和语音导览。你扫个码就能听讲解。有些博物馆还会用AR或VR，让你看到东西在过去可能是什么样。
科技也让“远距离参观”更容易。博物馆可以把展览放到网上，人们在家也能看视频或做线上参观。
但也有一个小问题。有些人太专注拍照，反而没花足够时间认真看展品。

- What are the benefits of technology for learning history?
> It’s really helpful. Technology makes learning history more visual and easier to get into.
Because of that, people understand faster and remember better. It also makes history feel less dry, so students are more interested.
Another big benefit is access. You can look up sources anytime, and you can learn in different formats. Videos and interactive tools make a big difference.
For example, a documentary or a short video can give you a clear picture quickly. And a timeline or an interactive map can help you connect events with time and place.
我觉得好处很明显，科技让学历史更直观，也更容易入门。
因此理解会更快、记得更牢。历史也没那么枯燥，兴趣更容易被带起来。
另外就是获取资料更方便，随时都能查，而且学习形式更多样。视频和一些互动工具会特别有用。
比如看纪录片或短视频，能很快建立画面感。再比如用时间线或互动地图，把事件的时间顺序和地点串起来，会更清楚。

- Why do people visit museums?
> I think people visit museums for a real cultural experience. It’s not just about looking at objects.
For example, seeing real artifacts or famous paintings feels different. The details are more powerful in person. Some parents also take their kids there, because it’s a fun way to learn.
Museums also create a special atmosphere. They usually tell a story, so history feels clearer. And for many people, it’s a calm way to spend a weekend.
In the end, museums help people learn and reflect. They also give people a break from busy life, and that’s why they’re still popular.
我觉得大家去博物馆，主要是为了获得一种真实的文化体验，不只是“看看展品”这么简单。
比如看真文物或者名画，现场的细节冲击感更强。还有很多家长会带孩子去，因为这是一个边玩边学的方式。
另外博物馆本身也有氛围，它会把内容串成一条故事线，所以历史更好理解。对很多人来说，这也是一种很安静的放松方式，周末去逛一圈挺舒服的。
总的来说，博物馆既能让人增长见识，也能给人一种情绪上的满足。它还能让人更珍惜自己本土的文化，所以一直都有人去。

### APP应用
- Describe a program or app on your computer or phone.
  You should say:
  What it is?
  How often you use it?
  When/how you use it?
  When/how you found it?
  And explain how you feel about it?
> Well, the app I'd like to talk about today is called Xiaohongshu, which translates to 'Little Red Book' in English. It's a hugely popular social media and e-commerce platform in China, primarily known for user-generated content related to lifestyle, fashion, beauty, and travel. Essentially, its main function is to allow users to share their daily lives through short videos and photo posts, often accompanied by detailed reviews and recommendations. You can find everything from makeup tutorials and travel guides to cooking recipes and home decor inspiration there. What makes it particularly special for me is how it helped me solve a real-life problem recently. I was struggling to find effective ways to organize my small apartment, and I stumbled upon some incredibly creative and practical storage solutions shared by other users on Xiaohongshu. I mean, these weren't just generic tips; they were specific product recommendations and DIY hacks that perfectly fit my space and budget. Using the app gave me a strong sense of inspiration and empowerment. It wasn't just about finding solutions; it was about connecting with a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about sharing and discovering new ideas. It's truly a platform that sparks creativity and helps you navigate various aspects of modern living.
> 今天我要讲的应用程序叫小红书,英文翻译过来就是小红书。它是中国一个非常受欢迎的社交媒体和电子商务平台,主要以与生活方式,时尚,美容和旅游相关的用户生成内容而闻名。本质上,它的主要功能是允许用户通过短视频和照片帖子分享他们的日常生活,通常还附有详细的评论和建议。您可以在那里找到从化妆教程和旅行指南到烹饪食谱和家居装饰灵感的一切。它对我来说特别的是它如何帮助我解决了最近现实生活中的一个问题。我正在努力寻找有效的方法来整理我的小公寓,偶然发现了一些令人难以置信的创意和实用的存储解决方案,这些解决方案由小红书上的其他用户分享。我的意思是,这些不仅仅是一般的技巧;它们是完全适合我的空间和预算的具体产品推荐和DIY技巧。使用该应用程序给了我强烈的灵感和力量感。这不仅仅是寻找解决方案;而是与志同道合的人组成的社区建立联系,他们热衷于分享和发现新想法。它确实是一个激发创造力并帮助您驾驭现代生活各个方面的平台。

- What are the differences between old and young people when using apps?
> They use apps quite differently. Younger people usually use more apps, and they switch between them fast. 
Older people often keep things simple. They use fewer apps, and they prefer apps that are easy to understand. They may only use the main functions. They also worry more about making mistakes ，like paying by accident.
For example, a young person may explore settings and change things to fit their habits. An older person may stick to the same few apps for a long time. They may only open them when they really need them.
So the difference is mainly about needs and confidence. Younger people want speed and variety. Older people want clarity and safety.
我觉得年轻人和老年人用App差别挺明显的。年轻人一般装得多、切得快。
老年人通常更偏“用得简单”。他们用的App数量更少，更喜欢那种一看就懂的。很多时候他们只用最核心的功能，而且更担心出错，比如不小心花钱。
举个例子，年轻人可能会去研究设置，把界面和提醒改成自己习惯的样子；老年人往往长期只用固定几个App，需要的时候才打开。
 所以差异不只是年龄本身，更是需求、熟练度和安全感不一样。

- Why do some people not like using apps?
> Some people don’t like using apps because they find them annoying. There are too many steps. You need to sign up, confirm codes, and allow permissions. It feels like a lot of work.
Another big reason is safety. Some people worry about privacy. They don’t want apps to track them. They also worry about paying by accident. If they don’t fully trust an app, they would rather not use it.
Also, apps change all the time. Updates can move buttons around. Older users can feel lost. Even younger people can get tired of learning new layouts.
So I think it’s not that they hate technology. They just want something simple and under control.
有些人不喜欢用App，最常见的原因就是觉得麻烦、而且没有安全感。很多App步骤特别多，要注册、输验证码、还要点一堆权限弹窗，用起来就很累。
另一个原因是安全问题。有些人担心隐私，不想被追踪；也有人怕误操作，比如不小心扣费。如果对一个App不够信任，他们宁愿不用。
还有就是App变化太快，经常更新，按钮位置一变就找不到。年纪大的人更容易迷路，年轻人也可能觉得烦。
所以我觉得他们不是讨厌科技，只是更想要简单、可控的方式。

- What apps are popular inyour country? Why?
> In China, the most popular apps are usually the ones people “can’t avoid”. They solve daily needs, and they also keep people entertained.
WeChat is a big one. People use it to talk to friends and family. Many people also use it to pay, so it becomes part of daily life.
Another popular app is Douyin. It’s not just fun. The recommendations are strong, so you keep watching the next video. You don’t even notice the time.
So the reason is simple. These apps are useful, and they are addictive in a light way. That’s why almost everyone has them.
在中国，最火的App通常就是那种你“绕不开”的。它们解决日常刚需，同时也很能让人放松和上头。
微信就是典型。大家用它联系朋友家人，也经常用它付款，所以它直接变成生活的一部分。
另一个很火的是抖音。它不只是好玩，更关键是推荐太强了，一个接一个，你就会一直看，时间不知不觉就过去了。
所以原因很简单：有用 + 容易沉迷一点点。大家自然都装着，而且天天用。

- Should parents limit their children’s use of computer programs and computer games? Why and how?
> Yes, I think parents should limit it, but not ban it. Kids need fun, and some programs are useful. But without rules, it can get out of control.
Games can help children relax, and some software can teach real skills. The problem is that many kids don’t know when to stop.
So parents should set clear boundaries. For example, on weekdays it can be one hour a day. Parents should also check what the child plays or uses, not only the time.
If the limits are clear, sleep and study stay stable. If there are no limits, the child can get addicted and fall into a messy routine.
我觉得家长应该限制，但没必要完全禁止。孩子也需要娱乐，而且有些软件确实有用；但如果没规则，很容易失控。
游戏能让孩子放松，一些软件也能学到真技能。问题是很多孩子不知道什么时候该停。
所以家长要设清楚边界。比如平日一天一小时左右，同时也要看孩子玩什么、用什么，而不只是盯着时长。
规则清楚的话，睡眠和学习会更稳；但如果没限制，就可能上瘾，作息也会乱掉。

- Do you think young people are more and more reliant on these programs?
> Yes, I think young people rely on these programs more and more. They use them for many parts of daily life.
A lot of things are now on one screen. They study with apps, talk to friends online, and relax with videos or games. When something is that easy, people naturally use it more.
For example, many students use learning apps to do homework or review. In their free time, they may watch short videos or play games.
The good side is convenience. But the bad side is that it can hurt focus. If they use it too much, they may feel bored without it.
我觉得是的，年轻人确实越来越依赖这些程序了，因为它们已经进到生活的很多部分。
现在很多事情都集中在一块屏幕上：学习用App，社交也在线上，放松的时候就刷视频或玩游戏。越方便，就越容易用得更多。
比如很多学生会用学习软件写作业、复习；空闲时就刷短视频或者玩游戏。
好处当然是省事，但坏处是容易影响专注。如果用得太多，离开这些东西反而会觉得无聊、不习惯。

- What do you think about some countries banning children from using social media?
> I’m partly in favour of it, but I don’t think a total ban is always the best idea. The goal is to protect kids, and that part makes sense.
A ban can reduce risks, especially for younger children. It can lower the chance of addiction, and it can keep them away from harmful content.
But if you ban it completely, many kids will still find a way around it. They might use a friend’s account or lie about their age. Then it becomes harder for parents and schools to guide them.
So I prefer a balanced approach. Set a minimum age and limit screen time. Teach kids how to use social media safely, too.
我有点支持，但我不太赞成完全“一刀切”地禁。出发点是保护孩子，这个我能理解。
禁令确实能减少风险，尤其对低龄孩子更友好。比如能降低沉迷的可能，也能让他们少接触一些不合适的内容。
但如果完全禁止，很多孩子还是会想办法绕过去，比如借朋友账号、谎报年龄。那反而更难监管，也更难引导。
所以我更喜欢折中方案：设定年龄门槛，再加使用时长限制。同时也要教孩子基本的网络素养，知道什么能信、什么该避开。

### 微笑的场合
- Describe an occasion when many people were smiling.
  You should say:
  When it happened?
  Who you were with?
  What happened?
  And explain why most people were smiling.
> Well, let me tell you about a time when everyone was beaming with joy, and that was at my friend Sarah's 24th birthday party. It took place a couple of months ago at a cozy, rustic-themed restaurant downtown, which she absolutely adores. The atmosphere was already buzzing with excitement even before the main event. The highlight of the evening, and the reason for all the smiles, was a surprise gift we had all secretly chipped in for. Sarah had always dreamed of traveling to Japan, so we got her a complete travel package, including flights and accommodation. When she unwrapped the gift and saw the tickets, her eyes widened, and a huge, genuine smile spread across her face. Everyone present, seeing her reaction, couldn't help but smile too, some even tearing up with happiness for her. The party continued with an incredibly joyful vibe. Her initial shock quickly turned into overwhelming excitement, and she spent the rest of the evening chatting animatedly about her upcoming trip. The energy was infectious, and it felt like everyone was celebrating not just her birthday, but also her dreams coming true. We all had a fantastic time, sharing stories and laughter late into the night. I remember feeling incredibly happy and uplifted that night. It was truly heartwarming to witness such pure joy and to be a part of making someone's dream a reality. Seeing so many people genuinely happy and smiling, all for a common reason, was a beautiful experience that definitely left a lasting impression on me.
> 好吧,让我告诉你一个每个人都兴高采烈的时刻,那是在我朋友莎拉的24岁生日派对上。事情发生在几个月前,在市中心一家舒适的乡村主题餐厅举行,她非常喜欢这家餐厅。甚至在主要活动开始之前,气氛就已经沸腾了。当晚的亮点,也是所有微笑的原因,是我们都秘密花钱买的一份惊喜礼物。莎拉一直梦想着去日本旅行,所以我们为她提供了完整的旅行套餐,包括机票和住宿。当她打开礼物的包装看到门票时,她睁大了眼睛,脸上绽放出巨大的、真诚的微笑。在场的每个人看到她的反应,也都忍不住笑了,有些人甚至为她高兴得热泪盈眶,聚会气氛非常欢乐。她最初的震惊很快变成了压倒性的兴奋,整个晚上她都在热情地谈论即将到来的旅行。这种能量具有感染力,感觉每个人不仅在庆祝她的生日,也在庆祝她的梦想成真。我们都度过了一段美好的时光,分享故事和笑声直到深夜。我记得那天晚上我感到非常高兴和振奋。目睹如此纯粹的喜悦并成为实现某人梦想的一部分,真是令人温馨。看到这么多人真诚地快乐和微笑,这一切都是出于一个共同的原因,是一次美好的经历,绝对给我留下了持久的印象。

- Do you think people who like to smile are more friendly?
> In general, yes, people who smile a lot look more friendly. A smile is a simple signal. It tells others, “I’m open.” It also makes the atmosphere feel lighter. So it’s easier to start a conversation.
But I don’t think we should judge only by smiling. Some people smile because it’s a habit. It doesn’t always mean they are warm and helpful. And some people don’t smile much, especially when they are shy. They can still be kind and reliable once you know them.
So I’d say smiling is a plus. It helps with first impressions. But real friendliness shows up in actions, like listening, being patient, and showing respect.
一般来说会的，爱笑的人通常看起来更友好。微笑是一种很简单的信号，会让别人觉得你更开放，气氛也更轻松，所以更容易聊起来。
但我也不觉得能只靠微笑下结论。有些人爱笑只是习惯，不一定真的热情；也有人不怎么笑，可能是害羞或者不太会表达，但相处久了其实很善良、很靠谱。
所以我觉得微笑是加分项，尤其是第一印象上很占优势。但真正的友好还是看行动，比如愿不愿意听你说、有没有耐心、以及是否尊重别人。

- Why do most people smile in photographs?
> I think most people smile in photos because they want to look good. A smile usually makes your face look softer. It also makes you look more positive and energetic. So it feels like the safest choice.
Another reason is social. When you take a group photo, smiling helps the picture look warm. It shows a good mood. If one person looks serious, the whole photo can feel a bit awkward.
Also, photos are often used as memories. People want to record happy moments, not stress. So smiling becomes a habit. It’s simple, and it rarely goes wrong.
我觉得大多数人拍照会笑，主要是因为想让照片更好看。微笑会让脸看起来更柔和，也更有精神、更积极，所以它就是最稳的选择。
还有一个原因是社交。拍合照的时候大家都笑，照片会更温暖、更有氛围。如果有一个人特别严肃，整张照片可能就会有点尴尬。
另外照片很多时候是用来留回忆的。大家更想记录开心的瞬间，而不是压力和疲惫。所以久而久之，笑就变成了一个习惯：简单，而且不容易出错。

- Do women smile more than men? Why?
> In many situations, yes, women seem to smile more than men. But I don’t think it’s a fixed rule. A big reason is social expectations. Women are often expected to look warm and approachable. Smiling helps with that.
Men can face a different expectation. People may expect them to look serious or “strong.” Because of that, some men keep a more neutral face, even when they are friendly.
You can see this in daily life. In customer service or small talk, women often smile to make the moment feel easier. Men may choose a calmer expression instead. So I’d say the difference is more about culture and habits. Personality matters too.
很多场合里，我觉得女性“看起来”确实更常笑一点，但我不认为这是绝对规律。一个很大的原因是社会期待不一样。女性经常被期待显得更温和、更好相处，微笑就是最简单的方式。
男性有时候面对的期待不同，别人可能希望他们看起来更严肃、更稳，所以有些男性就会更常保持中性表情，但这不代表他们不友好。
在生活里也挺常见的，比如服务场景或者日常寒暄，女生更容易用笑来缓和气氛；男生可能用比较平静的表情来回应。所以我觉得差异更多来自文化和习惯，性格当然也占很大部分。

- Do people smile more when they are younger or older?
> I think people often smile more when they are younger. Younger people usually have more social situations. They meet new people at school or at work. Smiling helps them connect. It also makes them look friendly.
But older people can smile a lot too. Their smile may look calmer. It may come from feeling more relaxed and confident. They don’t always need to smile to “fit in,” so they may not smile as often in public.
So I’d say younger people smile more in daily life. Older people may smile less often, but their smiles can feel more genuine. In the end, it depends on stress and the social environment.
我觉得总体来说年轻人更常笑一点。因为年轻人的社交场景更多，在学校或工作里会遇到很多人，微笑更像一种“社交工具”，能更快拉近距离，也显得更友好。
但年纪大的人也会笑很多，只是那种笑更平静，更多来自放松和自信。他们不一定需要靠微笑去融入，所以在公共场合可能不会那么常挂着笑。
所以我会说，日常里年轻人更爱笑；年长者可能笑得没那么频繁，但往往更自然、更真实。最后还是看压力和社交环境，而不是只看年龄。

- Is smiling important in your culture?
> Yes, I’d say smiling is quite important in my culture. It’s a simple way to show friendliness. But it also depends on the situation.
In serious moments, people may not smile much, and that feels normal. Some people also don’t smile a lot with strangers, especially in big cities. They just want to keep a bit of distance.
For example, in service jobs, a smile is seen as polite. And when you meet friends, smiling makes the atmosphere more relaxed.
Overall, smiling can soften relationships and make communication smoother. But if you smile too much, it can look fake, and that can be awkward.
我觉得在我的文化里，微笑挺重要的，它是一种很简单的友好信号。但也确实要看场合，不是一直笑。
在比较严肃的场景里，大家不怎么笑其实很正常。还有一些人面对陌生人也不会太热情，尤其在大城市，大家会保持一点距离感。
比如服务行业，微笑通常代表礼貌。跟朋友见面笑一下，氛围也会更放松。
总体来说，微笑能把关系变软一点，让沟通更顺。但如果笑得太多，别人可能觉得不真诚，反而会尴尬。

- Are there any occasions when people need to pretend to smile?
> Yes, I think there are. Sometimes people do a polite smile, even if they don’t really feel like it.
At work, it can be part of being professional, especially in service jobs. In social situations, a small smile can also keep things smooth and avoid awkward moments.
If people never do that, their mood shows on their face all the time. That can make others uncomfortable, and the atmosphere can get tense.
So I think a “pretend smile” is sometimes a social tool. It helps people get through the moment. But it shouldn’t be overdone, because it can look fake.
我觉得有的，有些场合确实需要那种“礼貌性微笑”，哪怕你当下不太想笑。
在工作里，尤其是服务行业，这算是一种职业表现。社交场合也一样，轻轻笑一下，能把气氛撑住，不至于尴尬。
如果一个人完全不装，情绪都写在脸上，别人可能会不舒服，场面也更容易僵住。
所以我觉得适度的“假笑”有时候就是一种社交工具，帮你把当下过掉。但也别过度，不然会显得很假。

### 喜欢画画的孩子
- Describe a child who loves drawing/painting.
  You should say:
  Who he/she is?
  How/when you knew him/her?
  How often he/she draws/paints?
  And explain why you think he/she loves drawing/painting?
> Well, I'd like to talk about a child I know who absolutely loves drawing, and that's my neighbor's kid, a lovely girl named Lily. She's incredibly imaginative and has a really vibrant personality, always full of energy and curiosity. I remember one particular instance when she drew a stunning picture of a fantastical forest, complete with talking animals and glowing flowers. It was for a local art competition, and to everyone's delight, especially hers, she actually won first prize! I think her passion for drawing stems from a very young age; she's always been fascinated by colors and shapes. Her parents told me she started doodling even before she could properly walk, and it just naturally evolved into a deep love for artistic expression. For her, drawing isn't just a hobby; it's a way to bring her inner world to life, and that's truly inspiring to witness.
> 嗯,我想谈谈我认识的一个非常喜欢画画的孩子,那是我邻居的孩子,一个可爱的女孩,名叫莉莉。她富有想象力,性格非常充满活力,总是充满活力和好奇心。我记得有一个特别的例子,当时她画了一幅令人惊叹的梦幻森林画,里面有会说话的动物和发光的花朵。这是为了参加当地的一场艺术比赛,令每个人,尤其是她的,她竟然获得了一等奖!我认为她对绘画的热情源于很小的时候;她总是对颜色和形状着迷。她的父母告诉我,她甚至在能正常行走之前就开始涂鸦,这自然而然地演变成对艺术表达的深深热爱。对她来说,绘画不仅仅是一种爱好;这是一种将她的内心世界带入生活的方式,这确实令人鼓舞。

- What is the right age for a child to learn drawing?
> I think children can start learning drawing quite early. Even toddlers can begin with simple crayons. At that age, it should feel like play, not a lesson.
Drawing helps kids in a few ways. It improves hand control. It also helps them express ideas. Many children can’t explain feelings well with words, so drawing is a good outlet.
But I don’t think parents should push too hard too early. If the class is too strict, kids may feel stressed. They may even think they are “bad at it.” Then they might lose interest.
So for me, the best age is very young, like preschool. Keep it fun and simple. If the child enjoys it, they can learn more skills later.
我觉得孩子学画画可以很早开始，越早越好，但一定要“玩着学”，不要一上来就搞得很正规。甚至幼儿用蜡笔随便涂涂画画，其实就已经是在学了。
画画能帮孩子提升手部控制，也能帮助他们表达想法。有些小孩用语言说不清自己的情绪，但用画就能表达出来。
不过我不建议太早就压强度。如果课程太严，孩子会有压力，甚至会觉得“我画得不好”，然后就不想画了。
所以我觉得学画画的合适年龄是学龄前就可以开始。重点是开心和兴趣，技巧以后慢慢补就行。

- Why do most children draw more often than adults do?
> I think children draw more often because drawing feels natural to them. They have more free time. They also have stronger curiosity. For kids, drawing is like play. They don’t worry too much about doing it “perfectly.”
Children also use drawing to communicate. Sometimes they can’t explain ideas with words. A picture is easier. For example, when they feel bored in class, they may doodle. When they want to share an idea, they may draw it instead of writing a long message.
Adults are different. They are busy, and they often feel tired after work. They also judge themselves more. Many adults worry about looking childish, so they stop drawing.
我觉得孩子更常画画，是因为对他们来说这件事更自然。孩子空闲时间更多，好奇心也更强，而且画画对他们就是“玩”，不会太在意画得完不完美。
孩子还会用画画来表达。很多时候他们用语言说不清想法，一张图反而更容易。比如上课无聊就会涂鸦；想表达一个点子时，可能会直接画出来，而不是写一大段。
成年人就不一样了。大家更忙，下班也更累，而且更容易自我评判。很多成年人还会担心“画画显得幼稚”，所以就不画了。

- Why do some people visit galleries or museums instead of viewing artworks online?
> Some people go to galleries or museums because it feels more real. You are standing in front of the original work, and it feels special.
Also, many details are hard to see on a screen. In person, you can see the real size, the real colors, and the surface of the artwork.
Another reason is attention. In a museum, people are more likely to slow down and look carefully. Online, it’s easy to get distracted and just scroll away.
And for many people, it’s not only about the art. It’s also about the whole experience. They can join a guided tour, see a special exhibition, or spend time with friends.
有些人去美术馆或博物馆，是因为线下更真实，感受也更强。你站在原作面前，会觉得很特别。
而且很多细节在屏幕上不容易看清。现场能看到真实的大小、颜色，以及作品表面的质感。
还有一个原因是注意力。在博物馆里，人更容易慢下来认真看；但线上很容易分心，刷两下就划走。
另外对很多人来说，看展不只是看画。更重要的是整体体验，比如参加导览、看特展，或者和朋友一起逛。

- Do you think galleries and museums should be free of charge?
> I think basic entry should be free, at least for public museums. It makes culture easier to reach for everyone.
If tickets are too expensive, some people will just stop going. Students and low-income families are the first to be affected.
But I don’t think everything has to be free. Museums still need money for security, cleaning, and protecting the artworks. They also need to repair old pieces from time to time.
So a good balance is free regular entry, and paid special exhibitions. People can choose what they want, and museums can still run well.
我觉得基础门票最好免费，至少公立博物馆可以这样做。这样文化资源更容易被所有人接触到。
如果票价太贵，一些人就会不去了，学生和低收入家庭影响最大。
但我也不觉得所有内容都必须免费。博物馆需要钱来做安保、清洁、保护展品，还要定期修复一些老作品。
所以比较好的方式是常规展免费、特展收费。观众可以自己选择，博物馆也能更稳定地运营。

- How do art works inspire people?
> Artworks inspire people because they connect with our feelings. They also show us new possibilities.
For example, a line in a film or a scene in a painting can remind you of your own life. It can make you think, “Maybe I can do it differently.”
Art also helps people name their emotions. When you can describe your feelings, you feel less alone. You may become braver to speak up or try something new.
In the end, art can give people a push. It can bring confidence, and it can lead to real action.
艺术能启发人，是因为它能和我们的情绪产生连接。它也会让我们看到新的可能性。
比如电影里一句台词，或者一幅画里的一个画面，会让你想到自己的生活。你会开始想：我是不是也能换一种方式来做。
艺术还会帮人把情绪说清楚。当你能描述自己的感受时，你就没那么孤单。你也会更敢表达，或者更敢去尝试新东西。
说到底，艺术会推你一把。它能带来信心，也可能真的促成行动。

- What are the differences between reading a book and visiting a museum?
> To me, the biggest difference is the way you take in information. Reading a book is deeper, and you control the pace. Visiting a museum is more visual and more “in the moment.”
That said, they can work really well together. A museum can spark your interest first. Then a book can fill in the details later, or you can do it the other way around.
For example, a history book can give you a clear timeline. You can understand the background step by step. In a museum, seeing real objects can be more powerful, because the details feel real.
So if you want a systematic understanding, reading is usually better. If you want a quick and vivid experience, a museum is a great choice.
我觉得最大差别是信息获取方式不一样。读书更偏深度，而且节奏你自己控制。逛博物馆更直观，也更有那种现场感。
但这两件事其实很互补。你可以先去博物馆被“点燃兴趣”，回来再用书把细节补齐。反过来也行，先读一点再去看展，理解会更深。
比如读历史书，你能把时间线和背景捋得很清楚。逛博物馆看到真东西，冲击感更强，很多细节会一下子变得真实。
所以如果你想系统理解，读书更合适。如果你想快速、有画面感地感受一下，博物馆会更适合。

### 常做计划的人
- Describe a person who makes plans a lot and is good at planning.
  You should say:
  Who he/she is?
  How you knew him/her?
  What plans he/she makes?
  And explain how you feel about this person?
> Well, the person I'd like to talk about is one of my university roommates, actually my best friend, named Noble. We lived together for four years during our undergraduate studies. He is, by nature, an incredibly organized and meticulous person. He always has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve and how to get there. The most impressive plan he ever made, and one that really stuck with me, was his comprehensive career development plan. This wasn't just a vague idea; it was a detailed roadmap he created during our final year at university, outlining his goals for the next five to ten years. I remember being absolutely amazed by his foresight and dedication. His plan covered everything from the specific skills he needed to acquire, to the companies he wanted to work for, and even the certifications he aimed to get. Witnessing his methodical approach truly inspired me to think more strategically about my own future, and I've tried to adopt some of his planning habits ever since.
> 嗯,我想谈论的人是我的一个大学室友,实际上是我最好的朋友,名叫莎拉。本科期间,我们一起生活了四年。她天生是一个非常有组织性和一丝不苟的人。她总是清楚自己想要实现什么以及如何实现目标。她制定过的最令人印象深刻的计划,也是真正让我着迷的计划,是她全面的职业发展计划。这不仅仅是一个模糊的想法;这是她在大学最后一年制定的一份详细的路线图,概述了她未来五到十年的目标。我记得她的远见和奉献精神让我感到非常惊讶。她的计划涵盖了一切,从她需要获得的具体技能到她想工作的公司,甚至她想要获得的认证。目睹她有条不紊的方法确实激励了我更有战略性地思考自己的未来,从那时起我就尝试采用她的一些规划习惯。

- Do you think it’s important to plan ahead?
> Yes, I think it’s important to plan ahead. It helps you stay organized and feel calmer.
When I have a plan, I know what I should do first. I don’t waste time on random things. It also makes me less stressed because I can see a clear direction.
But I don’t think planning means planning every minute. Life changes, so I always leave some space.
For example, before an exam, I set a simple weekly plan and I leave time for review. Before a trip, I book the main things like transport and a hotel. Then I decide the smaller details later.
So overall, planning ahead is useful. It usually makes things easier and smoother.
我觉得提前规划很重要。它能让你更有条理，也更安心。
当我有计划时，我知道先做什么，不会把时间浪费在一些乱七八糟的事上。而且我能看到一个明确方向，所以压力也会小一点。
但我不觉得规划等于把每一分钟都安排死。生活会变，所以我会留一点空间。
比如考试前我会做一个简单的周计划，并留出复习时间；旅行前我会先订好交通和酒店这种关键的，其他小细节后面再决定。
所以总体来说，提前规划很有用。它通常会让事情更轻松、更顺。

- What activities do we need to plan ahead?
> I think we need to plan ahead for activities with many “fixed rules”. If there are time slots or deadlines, you can’t just do it anytime.
Small things can be spontaneous, of course. But once an activity depends on other people or a system, last-minute plans often fail.
For example, seeing a doctor usually needs an appointment. Another example is taking an exam or applying for a visa. These things have clear dates and steps.
If you plan early, you avoid stress and mistakes. If you wait until the last minute, you may miss the chance and waste a whole day.
我觉得真正需要提前计划的活动，通常都有很多“固定规则”。只要有预约、名额、截止时间，你就不能想去就去。
当然，小事可以随性一点。但一旦事情要依赖别人或系统，临时安排往往就会翻车。
比如看医生通常要预约。还有像考试或者办签证这种事情，流程和日期都很明确。
提前规划的话，就更稳，也更不容易踩坑；但拖到最后一刻，很可能错过窗口，最后白跑一趟。

- Do you think children should plan their future careers?
> I think children should plan a little, but they shouldn’t lock in one job. It’s better to plan the path, not the exact title.
Having a direction is helpful. It makes kids more active, and it helps parents guide them.But career choices are based on real experience. Most children don’t have that yet, so one early decision can be unrealistic.
A better idea is to plan skills and exploration. For example, they can build communication skills, writing skills, or basic tech skills. They can also choose school subjects and clubs to test what they like.
So yes, planning is useful. Just keep it flexible and practical.
我觉得孩子可以做一点规划，但不应该把某一个职业“定死”。更好的做法是规划路径，而不是锁定一个职位名称。
有方向当然是好事，会让孩子更主动，也方便家长给建议。
但职业选择需要真实体验支撑。大多数孩子还没有这些体验，所以太早做决定往往不太现实。
更好的方式是规划能力和探索。比如先把沟通、写作、基础技术这些能力练起来，同时通过选课和社团去验证自己喜欢什么、擅长什么。
所以我支持“有规划”。只是要保持灵活，而且要接地气。

- Should children ask their teachers or parents for advice when making plans?
> Yes, I think children should ask for advice. It can save them a lot of time and mistakes.
Ideally, they should ask both teachers and parents. Teachers usually know study plans better. They can suggest subjects, skills, and a good learning pace.
Parents are helpful in a different way. They know the child’s personality and daily habits. They can also give practical advice about time, stress, and family plans.
For example, if a child is choosing courses or preparing for exams, teachers are the best people to ask. If the child feels pressure or needs a better routine, parents can help more.
So I’d say ask both. Then make a final choice by yourself.
我觉得孩子应该去问建议。这样能少走弯路，也能少犯一些低级错误。
最理想的是老师和父母都问，但问的方向不一样。老师通常更懂学习规划，能建议选什么科目、练哪些能力、节奏怎么安排。
父母的帮助点不一样。他们更了解孩子的性格和日常习惯，也能给一些更现实的建议，比如时间怎么分配、压力怎么扛、家里有哪些安排。
比如选课、备考这种事，问老师更靠谱；如果孩子压力很大，或者想调整作息，父母可能更能帮上忙。
所以我觉得两边都听一听最好。最后自己做决定。

- Is making study plans popular among young people?
> Yes, I think making study plans is quite popular among young people. It becomes even more common when they have big exams.
A plan gives people a sense of control. It makes study feel less scary. Also, many people like checking tasks off a list. It feels satisfying.
For example, students often make weekly plans when they prepare for exams. Many of them also use apps to track tasks or use a timer.
But plans can also backfire. If the plan is too full, people feel stressed and guilty. Then they may stop following it.
我觉得挺流行的，尤其是遇到大考的时候，会更明显。
计划会给人一种“我能掌控”的感觉，学习就没那么吓人了。而且很多人很喜欢把任务打勾，那种完成感挺上头的。
比如备考的时候，很多学生会做周计划；也有人用App记任务，或者用计时器来逼自己专注。
但计划也可能适得其反。如果排得太满，人就会压力大、内疚感强，最后反而容易直接放弃执行。

- Do you think choosing a college major is closely related to a person’s future career?
> Yes, it’s related, but it doesn’t decide your whole future. Your major gives you a base, and it affects your first few steps.
For some majors, the link is very strong. Medicine and law are good examples. You need the right training, so your major matters a lot.
But for many jobs, employers care more about skills and experience. People build these through internships, projects, and self-study. So changing direction is possible.
So choosing the right major can make life easier at the start. If you choose a different one, it’s not the end. You just need extra time to build the skills you lack.
我觉得专业和未来工作是有关联的，但它不会决定你的一辈子。专业能打一个基础，也会影响你前几步走得顺不顺。
有些专业联系很强，比如医学、法律，你需要对应的训练路径，所以专业真的很关键。
但很多工作里，公司更看技能和经验。很多能力是通过实习、项目和自学练出来的，所以后面转方向也不是不可能。
所以选对专业会让起步更轻松；但选得不完全对也没关系，只是你要多花时间把缺的能力补起来。

### 想拥有的科技产品
- Describe a piece of technology (not a phone) that you would like to own.
  You should say:
  What it is?
  How much it costs?
  How you knew it?
  And explain why you would like to own it?
> Well, if I had to pick a piece of technology I'd really like to own, it would definitely be a home NAS, or Network Attached Storage. I mean, it's something I've been considering for a while now. This isn't just any external hard drive; it's a dedicated device that connects to my home network, offering a centralized location for all my digital files. The main draw for me is its massive storage capacity, which can be expanded as needed, and the ability to access my data from anywhere with an internet connection. You know, in this digital age, we accumulate so many precious memories – photos, videos, important documents. My current setup involves multiple external drives, and honestly, it's a bit of a mess. A NAS would streamline this entirely, acting as a reliable backup system for all those irreplaceable moments, ensuring they're safe and sound. Ultimately, owning a NAS would bring me a profound sense of peace of mind. The thought of losing years of family photos or crucial work files is quite daunting, so having a robust, automated backup solution would alleviate that anxiety significantly. It's not just about storage; it's about safeguarding my digital life and feeling secure.
> 好吧,如果我必须选择一项我真正想拥有的技术,那肯定是家庭NAS或网络附加存储。我的意思是,这是我考虑了一段时间的事情。这不仅仅是任何外部硬盘驱动器;它是一个连接到我的家庭网络的专用设备,为我的所有数字文件提供集中位置。对我来说,主要吸引力是它巨大的存储容量,可以根据需要扩展,以及通过互联网连接从任何地方访问我的数据的能力。你知道,在这个数字时代,我们积累了很多宝贵的记忆--照片、视频、重要的文件。我当前的设置涉及多个外部驱动器,老实说,有点混乱。NAS将完全简化这一过程,充当所有不可替代时刻的可靠备份系统,确保它们的安全可靠。最终,拥有一台NAS会给我带来一种深刻的安心感。一想到丢失多年的家庭照片或重要工作文件就相当令人畏惧,因此拥有一个强大的自动化备份解决方案将显着缓解这种焦虑。这不仅仅是存储的问题;这还关系到保护我的数字生活和安全感。

- What technology do young people like to use?
> Young people usually like technology that is fast and easy to use. They also like things that are fun.
So mobile phone features are the biggest one. Many young people use social apps and short-video apps every day. They also use their phones for payments and for study.
Besides phones, they like small smart devices. For example, wireless earbuds are very popular because they are convenient. Smart watches are also common, because they help people track steps and messages.
These technologies make life easier. But they can also be distracting, so it’s easy to spend too much time on them.
年轻人通常喜欢那种又快又省事的科技，而且最好还能带点娱乐。
所以最核心的还是手机相关功能。很多年轻人每天都用社交App和短视频App，也会用手机支付、学习。
除了手机，他们也很喜欢一些小型智能设备。比如无线耳机很受欢迎，因为方便；智能手表也挺常见，可以看消息、记步数。
这些东西确实让生活更轻松，但也更容易让人分心，一不小心就用太久。

- What are the differences between the technology of the past and that of today?
> The biggest difference is that today’s technology is faster and smarter. It’s also more connected to our daily life.
In the past, many devices did only one job. They were also less connected, so people relied more on offline ways. Today, many things are online, and one device can do many tasks.
For example, people used to use a phone just for calls. They also used paper maps when they got lost. Now a smartphone can do navigation, payment, messaging, and entertainment.
This change makes life more convenient and efficient. But it also makes people more dependent on tech, and privacy can become a bigger issue.
最大的区别是：现在的科技更快、更智能，也更融入日常生活。
过去很多设备功能比较单一，而且互相不怎么连接，所以人更多依赖线下方式。现在很多事情都在线上，一个设备就能完成很多任务。
比如以前手机主要就是打电话，迷路就看纸质地图。现在一部智能手机就能导航、支付、聊天、娱乐。
这些变化让生活更方便、更高效。但同时人也更依赖科技，隐私问题也会更突出。

- What are the differences between online and face-to-face communication?
> I don’t think it’s about which one is better. They solve different problems.
Online communication is efficient. You can send messages anytime, and you can talk to many people at once. You also have a record, so it’s easy to check details later.
But face-to-face communication is stronger for emotions. You get instant feedback, and you can feel the atmosphere. It’s also harder to hide your real feelings in person.
So for small things, online is enough. For bigger issues or emotional talks, meeting in person is usually safer and clearer.
我觉得差别不在于“哪种更好”，而是它们在解决不同的问题。
线上沟通效率很高。你随时可以发消息，也可以一次和很多人沟通，而且还有记录，细节之后也方便翻出来确认。
但面对面更适合处理情绪。你能马上看到反馈，也能感受到氛围，而且线下更难把真实情绪藏住。
所以小事线上就够了；但遇到更重要、或者带情绪的事情，当面聊通常更稳、更清楚。

- Do you think technology has changed the way people communicate?
> Yes, definitely. Technology has changed the way people communicate a lot. It makes communication faster and easier.
Without these tools, we would mainly rely on face-to-face talks and phone calls. That takes more time, so people probably wouldn’t communicate as often.
Now we can message anyone anytime, so staying connected is much easier. But text messages don’t show tone clearly. That’s why misunderstandings can happen.
Overall, it helps people stay in touch. At the same time, we need to choose our words more carefully.
我觉得肯定改变了，而且变化挺大，主要就是更快更方便了。
如果没有这些工具，我们主要就靠见面或者打电话。那种沟通更费时间，所以频率也会低很多。
现在随时都能发消息，保持联系变得很容易。但文字信息很难把语气表达清楚，所以也更容易产生误会。
总体来说，技术让联系更容易维持，但我们也得更注意措辞和沟通方式。

- What negative effects does technology have on people’s relationships?
> Yes, definitely. Technology has changed the way people communicate a lot. It makes communication faster and easier.
Without these tools, we would mainly rely on face-to-face talks and phone calls. That takes more time, so people probably wouldn’t communicate as often.
Now we can message anyone anytime, so staying connected is much easier. But text messages don’t show tone clearly. That’s why misunderstandings can happen.
Overall, it helps people stay in touch. At the same time, we need to choose our words more carefully.
是的，没错。科技极大地改变了人们的沟通方式，让交流变得更快捷、更便利。
如果没有这些工具，我们主要得依靠面对面交谈和打电话。那样耗时更多，人们可能就不会如此频繁地交流了。
现在我们随时都能给任何人发消息，保持联系变得容易得多。但文字信息无法清晰地传达语气，因此可能导致误解。
总体而言，科技帮助人们保持联络。与此同时，我们需要更加谨慎地斟酌措辞。

- What are the differences between making friends in real life and online?
> To me, the biggest difference is speed and depth. Online friendships start fast, but they can stay on the surface. Real-life friendships grow slower, but they usually feel more solid.
That said, you can still make real friends online. It just takes time, and trust needs to be built. If you can meet in person later, it often becomes much stronger.
For example, in real life, you become friends by sharing the same daily life, like school or work. Online, people often connect through common interests first, like games or a hobby group.
So online is great for meeting more people. Real life is better for building a long-term bond. Either way, you need time and effort.
我觉得最大差别是速度和深度不一样。线上交朋友很快，但很容易停在表面。线下交朋友慢一点，但通常更稳、更真实。
不过我也承认，线上也能交到真朋友，只是更需要时间去建立信任。如果后面能见个面，关系往往会更扎实。
比如线下朋友很多是一起上学、一起工作，在共同经历里慢慢熟起来。线上朋友一般先从共同兴趣开始，比如同一个圈子、同一个爱好群，聊着聊着才变熟。
所以线上更适合扩圈认识人，线下更适合把关系做深、做长久。无论哪种，最后都离不开时间和投入。

### 外国的短期停留
- Describe a place in a foreign country you would like to stay or work for a short time. 
  You should say: 
  What place it is? 
  Where you got to know this place? 
  What you will do there?
  Why you will stay or work there just for a short time?
> Well, that's an interesting question. If I had the opportunity to choose a short-term job in a foreign country, I would definitely opt for a volunteer position. More specifically, I'm talking about volunteering at a major international sporting event, like the Olympics or a World Cup, which I think would be an absolutely incredible experience. My primary motivation for wanting to do this is to immerse myself in a different culture and gain a unique perspective on how such large-scale events are organized. You know, I actually had a taste of this kind of work when I volunteered at the Asian Winter Games a few years ago. My role then was to welcome international delegations at the airport, which was really rewarding. I anticipate that this kind of volunteer work would be incredibly fulfilling, not just because of the chance to contribute to a global event, but also because I'm confident I'd learn a tremendous amount of new things, from cross-cultural communication skills to problem-solving in a dynamic environment. It's the satisfaction of growth and connection that truly appeals to me.
> 嗯,这是一个有趣的问题。如果我有机会在国外选择一份短期工作,我一定会选择志愿者职位。更具体地说,我指的是在重大国际体育赛事中担任志愿者,例如奥运会或世界杯,我认为这绝对是一次令人难以置信的经历。我想要这样做的主要动机是让自己沉浸在不同的文化中,并对如何组织此类大型活动有独特的视角。要知道,几年前我在亚冬会做志愿者时,其实就尝到了这种工作的滋味。当时我的角色是在机场欢迎国际代表团,这确实很有回报。我预计这种志愿者工作将会非常有成就感,不仅是因为有机会为全球活动做出贡献,而且还因为我相信我会学到大量的新东西,从跨文化沟通技巧到在动态环境中解决问题。成长和联系的满足感真正吸引我。

### 给别人建议
- Describe a time when you gave advice to others. 
  You should say: 
  When it was? 
  To whom you gave the advice? 
  What the advice was? 
  And explain why you gave the advice?
> Well, I remember a particular time when a good friend of mine was really struggling with his academic path. He was feeling quite stuck, you know, at a crossroads with his studies. This happened last semester, actually, when we were both in our second year of university. He was facing a major decision about his specialization, which was causing him a lot of stress and uncertainty. I advised him to thoroughly research the job market and future career prospects related to different specializations. I suggested he look into what skills were in demand and how various fields were evolving, rather than just focusing on his immediate interests. I also encouraged him to talk to alumni who were already working in those areas. After taking my advice, he spent a good few weeks diving deep into research and networking. This really helped him gain a clearer perspective on his options. Ultimately, he chose a specialization that aligned well with future opportunities, and he's now much more confident and motivated in his studies. It was great to see him find his direction.
> 嗯,我记得有一个特殊的时刻,我的一个好朋友在他的学术道路上真的很挣扎。他感觉自己陷入了学业的十字路口。事实上,这发生在上学期,当时我们都在大学二年级。他面临着一个关于专业化的重大决定,这给他带来了很大的压力和不确定性。我建议他彻底研究与不同专业相关的就业市场和未来职业前景。我建议他研究需要哪些技能以及各个领域如何发展,而不是只关注他的眼前利益。我还鼓励他与已经在这些领域工作的校友交谈。在接受了我的建议后,他花了好几周的时间深入研究和网络。这确实帮助他对自己的选择有了更清晰的看法。最终,他选择了与未来机会相匹配的专业,现在他对学习更加自信和积极。很高兴看到他找到了自己的方向。

- Should people prepare before giving advice?
> Yes, I think people should prepare a little before giving advice. At least, they should understand the situation first. If you don’t, your advice can be wrong. It can also sound careless.
A small preparation can make a big difference. You can ask a few questions. You can find out what the person really wants. You can also learn what limits they have, like time or money. Then your advice becomes more practical.
Also, it’s better to offer options. Don’t give one “perfect answer” like you know everything. Give two possible choices and explain them. That feels more respectful. So yes, preparation is important. It helps you give advice that actually works.
我觉得应该准备一下，起码先把情况搞清楚。你不了解背景就开口，很容易说错，还可能显得很敷衍，甚至误导对方。
其实一点点准备就够了，比如先问几个问题，搞清楚对方真正想要什么，以及他有什么限制，比如时间或预算。这样你的建议会更落地。
而且我觉得最好给选择，而不是一句话定死，像你什么都懂一样。给两种可能的方案，再简单解释一下，会更尊重对方。所以我认为准备很重要，它能让建议更有效。

- Is it good to ask advice from strangers online?
> I think it can be good to ask strangers online for advice, but you need to be careful. The good part is speed. You can get many opinions quickly. You may also learn new ideas you didn’t think of.
However, strangers don’t know you. Their advice may not fit your situation. Some people also give wrong information, on purpose or by mistake. So I think it’s better for low-risk topics, like choosing a phone or planning a trip. For big things, like money decisions or health problems, online advice should not be your main source.
So overall, online advice can be useful. Treat it as a reference. Compare different answers. Then make your own decision.
我觉得可以向网上陌生人问建议，但要小心一点。好处是速度快，你能很快看到很多观点，也可能学到一些你没想到的思路。
但问题是陌生人不了解你，他们的建议不一定适合你的情况。也有人会乱说，可能是误导，也可能是自己也不懂。所以我更建议用在低风险的话题上，比如选手机或者规划旅行。涉及钱和健康这种大事，就别把网上建议当主依据。
所以总体来说，网上建议有用，但只能当参考。多看几条、多对比一下，最后还是自己做决定。

- What are the personalities of people whose job is to give advice to others?
> People whose job is to give advice usually need to be patient and calm. They meet different people every day. They also hear many problems, so they can’t get emotional too easily.
They also need to be good listeners. They should ask the right questions. They should understand what the real issue is. Then they can give advice that fits. For example, a good advisor won’t rush. They will listen first and check the details. They may also offer a few options instead of one strong opinion.
Finally, they need to speak clearly. Advice is useless if people don’t understand it. So I’d say the key personalities are patience, empathy, and clear communication.
我觉得做“给别人建议”这种工作的人，性格上通常要比较稳，也要会听。因为他们每天会接触不同的人，也会听到很多问题，如果自己很容易情绪化，就很难帮到别人。
同时他们一定得是好听众，会问对问题，才能抓到真正的核心。比如一个好的咨询者不会急着下结论，而是先听完、再核对细节。然后给出几种可选方案，而不是用很强势的口吻只推一种。
最后还需要表达清楚。建议再好，别人听不懂也没用。所以我觉得关键性格就是耐心、同理心、还有清晰表达。

- What are the problems if you ask too many people for advice?
> If you ask too many people for advice, the biggest problem is confusion. Different people have different experiences. They also have different values. So their advice can easily conflict.
Then decision-making becomes harder. You keep comparing opinions. You may start to doubt yourself. That can create a lot of stress. It can also slow you down, because you keep waiting for “one more opinion.”
Another issue is relationships. If you follow one person’s advice, the others may feel ignored. They may think you don’t respect them. So asking too many people can cause small conflicts.
So I think it’s better to ask a few trusted people. Then you take responsibility and make the final call.
如果你问太多人建议，最大的问题就是把自己搞乱。每个人经历不同、价值观也不同，所以他们给的建议很容易互相矛盾。
这样一来，你反而更难做决定。你会不停对比、不断怀疑自己，压力也会上来。还可能越问越拖，因为你总觉得“再听一个人的意见也许就明白了”。
另外也会影响关系。你最后采纳了A的建议，B和C可能会觉得被忽视，觉得你不尊重他们，容易产生小摩擦。
所以我更建议问少数几个你信任的人，然后自己负责，自己做最后决定。

- Why do some people think it is better to ask for advice from friends than from parents?
> I think it’s because friends feel more relatable. Talking to them feels less stressful.
Friends are often in a similar stage of life, so they understand the situation better. With parents, some people worry about being judged or controlled. They don’t want to turn a simple question into a lecture.
For example, when it comes to relationships or social issues, many people prefer asking friends first. And for study or career choices, friends sometimes give more “real-life” advice, because they’re facing the same problems.
In the end, friends’ advice is easier to take in. Parents’ advice can be more long-term and stable, though. Ideally, people can listen to both and then decide.
我觉得主要是因为朋友更“同频”，聊起来压力更小。
朋友的经历通常更接近，很多问题他们更懂。跟父母聊的时候，有些人会担心被批评或者被管得太多，所以会更谨慎，甚至不太敢说太细。
比如感情或者社交方面的事，很多人会先找朋友聊。学习或职业选择上，朋友有时候也能给更“接地气”的建议，因为大家面对的是同一批现实问题。
但说到底，朋友的建议更容易入口，父母的建议可能更长线、更稳。最理想是两边都听一下，然后自己做决定。

- When would old people ask young people for advice?
> Older people usually ask young people for advice when it involves something new, especially technology.
For example, they might ask how to use a smartphone app, how to order things online, or how to book a doctor’s appointment. They may also ask about new platforms or trends, because young people are more up to date.
Young people are often faster with these things. They can show the steps clearly. And many older adults don’t want to feel left behind, so they ask for help.
In the end, this kind of advice reduces the information gap. It also helps older people stay more independent, and it can make the generation gap smaller.
我觉得老人找年轻人请教，通常是在问题跟“新东西”有关的时候，尤其是科技类的东西。
比如怎么用手机、怎么用某个 APP、怎么网购，或者怎么线上挂号之类的。还有一些新的平台、新的潮流玩法，老人也可能会问，因为年轻人更跟得上。
年轻人做这些事通常更熟练，操作也更快，而且能一步步教清楚。很多老人也不想被时代落下，所以会主动问。
总体来说，这样能减少信息差，让老人更独立，代沟也会小一点。

### 完美工作
- Describe a perfect job you would like to have in the future.
  You should say: 
  What it is? 
  How you knew it? 
  What you need to learn to get this job? 
  And explain why you think it is a perfect job for you?
> Well, the perfect job I'd absolutely love to have in the future is to be a satellite attitude and orbit control subsystem designer. This role primarily involves designing and optimizing satellite orbits, which is a highly specialized and technical field. What truly attracts me to this position is the incredible opportunity to contribute to major national projects. Imagine being part of something that pushes the boundaries of space exploration and technology! For me, this job isn't just about a career; it's about making a tangible contribution to my country's progress and scientific advancement. It's a profound sense of purpose that goes beyond personal achievement.
> 嗯,我未来绝对希望拥有的完美工作就是成为一名卫星姿态和轨道控制子系统设计师。该角色主要涉及设计和优化卫星轨道,这是一个高度专业化和技术领域。这个职位真正吸引我的是为国家重大项目做出贡献的绝佳机会。想象一下,成为突破太空探索和技术界限的事情的一部分!对我来说,这份工作不仅仅是一份职业;它是为了为我的国家的进步和科学进步做出切实的贡献。这是一种超越个人成就的深刻目标感。

- What kind of job can be called a 'dream job'?
> To me, a dream job isn’t the easiest job or the best-paid job. It’s a job you don’t hate waking up for.
A dream job fits your personality and your strengths. You feel you’re good at it, and you can keep improving. It also needs a life outside work. If a job destroys your health or your time, it’s hard to call it a dream.
For example, if someone enjoys talking to people, they may love a job like sales. If someone prefers quiet focus, they may enjoy coding.
So I think a dream job is really about fit and sustainability. It feels meaningful, and you can do it for years without burning out.
对我来说，梦中工作不是最轻松或者最赚钱的工作，而是那种你早上醒来不会讨厌去做的工作。
梦中工作要和你的性格、能力匹配。你做起来顺手，也能不断进步。同时它也得给你留生活空间。如果一份工作把健康和时间都耗光，很难叫“梦中工作”。
比如喜欢跟人打交道的人，可能会很喜欢销售；更喜欢安静专注的人，可能更享受写代码。
所以我觉得梦中工作核心就是“适配”和“能长期做”。它让你觉得有意义，也不会把你烧干。

- What jobs do children want to do when they grow up?
> Children want many different jobs when they grow up. Most of the time, they pick something that looks exciting or respected.
Today, social media has a big influence. Some kids want to be influencers or streamers because these jobs are very visible. They look fun and “cool”.
At the same time, traditional jobs are still common. Many children say they want to be doctors or teachers. These jobs sound meaningful, and adults often praise them.
In the end, kids’ ideas change quickly. As they get older, they learn more about real life. Then they usually choose something more practical.
孩子长大想做的工作其实很多。多数时候，他们会选那种看起来很刺激，或者很体面的职业。
现在社交媒体影响很大。有些孩子想当网红或者主播，因为这些职业曝光高，看起来也很“酷”、很好玩。
但传统职业也依然常见。很多孩子会说想当医生或者老师，因为听起来有意义，而且大人也更认可。
说到底，孩子的想法变化很快。长大一点、了解现实更多之后，他们通常会选更实际、更具体的方向。

- Do people’s ideal jobs change as they grow up?
> Yes, I think people’s ideal jobs often change as they grow up. It’s a very normal thing.
When people are younger, they often choose based on imagination. They pick jobs that look cool or fun, and they don’t think too much about the daily tasks.
But after they study more and try real work, they understand themselves better. They also learn what they can handle. Then they start to care more about stability, work hours, and stress.
For example, a student may want a job with lots of freedom and creativity. Later, they may prefer something more stable and predictable.
So overall, experience shapes people’s choices. Their “dream job” becomes more realistic over time.
我觉得会变，而且很常见。这其实很正常。
人年轻的时候更靠想象来选工作，觉得哪个看起来酷、好玩就想做，不太会去想每天具体在干什么。
但随着学习更多、真正去工作，人会更了解自己，也更清楚自己能扛什么、不能扛什么。于是他们会更在意稳定性、工作时间、压力这些现实问题。
比如学生可能更想要自由、有创意的工作；后来可能会更喜欢稳定、可预期一点的。
所以总体来说，经历会塑造选择。所谓“理想工作”往往会越来越现实。

- What should people consider when choosing jobs? 
> I think people should look at fit first, not only salary. A job needs to match your strengths and your personality.
Interest matters too. If you dislike the work every day, you will burn out quickly, even if the pay is good.
They should also think about long-term growth. Some jobs teach you useful skills and give you a clear path. That can be more valuable than a high starting salary.
Work-life balance is another point. For example, one job may pay more but comes with long hours and high stress. Another job may pay less but feels more stable and leaves you more time.
So overall, it’s about choosing something you can do well and keep doing. That usually leads to better results.
我觉得选工作要先看“适配度”，而不是只盯着工资。工作要和你的能力、性格匹配。
兴趣也很关键。如果你每天都很讨厌这份工作，就算钱多，也很容易很快被耗光。
还要考虑长期成长。有些工作能让你学到有用技能，也有更清晰的晋升路线，这种价值可能比起薪更重要。
工作和生活的平衡也要看。比如有的工作工资更高，但加班多、压力大；另一个工资低一点，但更稳定，也更有自己的时间。
所以总的来说，要选一个你能做得好、也能长期做下去的工作。这样更容易有好结果。

- Is salary the main reason why people choose a certain job? 
> For some people, yes, salary is a main reason. Money affects daily life, so it’s hard to ignore.
This is especially true for people with financial pressure. New graduates may also focus on pay because they want to become independent quickly.
But salary is not the only factor. Many people also care about stability, personal interest, and a good team. They want a job they can do for a long time.
If someone chooses only based on money, they may end up stressed or unhappy. A better choice is to consider salary and fit together. That usually leads to a more stable career.
对一部分人来说是的，工资确实是主要原因。钱会直接影响日常生活，很难不在意。
尤其是有经济压力的人会更看重工资。刚毕业的人也常常更关注薪资，因为他们想尽快经济独立。
但工资不是唯一因素。很多人也会看稳定性、兴趣，还有团队氛围。他们更想找一份能长期做下去的工作。
如果只按钱来选，最后可能会压力很大或者不开心。更好的方式是把工资和适配度一起考虑，这样职业发展通常更稳定。

- What kind of jobs are the most popular in your country?
> In my country, the most popular jobs are usually the ones that feel stable and have a clear career path.
People prefer lower-risk choices. It helps them feel secure and plan their future.
One reason is pay and benefits. Another reason is social recognition, and families often support these jobs more.
For example, many people aim for government-related jobs because they seem stable. Tech jobs are also popular, because they often offer better growth and higher salaries.
在我国家，最热门的工作通常是那种看起来稳定、而且有发展路径的。
大家更愿意选风险低的选择，因为更踏实，也更好规划未来。
原因一是收入和福利更稳。原因二是社会认可度更高，家里人也更支持。
比如很多人会考公务员或事业单位，因为稳定。互联网和科技类岗位也很热门，因为成长空间大、工资也更高。

### 想见的名人
- Describe a famous person you would like to meet. 
  You should say: 
  Who he/she is? 
  How you knew him/her? 
  How/where you would like to meet him/her? 
  And explain why you would like to meet him/her?
> Well, the famous person I'd really like to meet is Fan Zhendong, who is a world-renowned table tennis player from China. He's known for his incredibly confident and dominant playing style, which I find really captivating to watch. One particular moment that really stands out to me is when he won the Olympic gold medal. It was such an inspiring display of skill and determination. I'd love to meet him primarily because I deeply admire his achievements and his unwavering dedication to his sport. I think it would be fascinating to hear about his journey firsthand.
> 嗯,我真正想认识的名人是樊振东,他是一位来自中国的世界著名乒乓球运动员。他以其令人难以置信的自信和统治性的演奏风格而闻名,我觉得这真的很吸引人。对我来说真正引人注目的一个时刻是他赢得奥运会金牌的时候。这是一次令人鼓舞的技能和决心的展示。我很想见到他,主要是因为我深深钦佩他的成就和他对运动的坚定奉献。我认为直接了解他的旅程将会很有趣。

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a famous child?
> Being a famous child has some clear advantages. But it also brings serious downsides.
On the positive side, they often get better opportunities. They may have access to good training, a strong team, and better income. This can help them develop their talent faster.
However, the biggest problem is pressure. They are watched all the time, and they may lose privacy. They can also face harsh comments online. That can affect their confidence and mental health.
For example, they may not have a normal school life, because people take photos and talk about them. They may also feel they must always perform well.
So overall, it can be a good thing if adults protect them and set clear boundaries. If not, fame can hurt their growth.
童星出名确实有优势，但风险也很明显。最大的好处是资源来得早。比如更好的训练、更大的机会，起点会更高。
但坏处是生活很容易被公开。隐私几乎没有了，而且大家会一直评价你。哪怕一个小失误也可能被放大成“新闻”。这种压力会慢慢堆起来。对一个还在成长的孩子来说，这可能影响自信，也可能影响心理状态。
所以我觉得它不是简单的好或坏，关键看保护和边界。如果父母和团队能控制曝光、让生活保持平衡，名气可能是助推器；但如果失控了，它就会夺走正常童年。

- What can today’s children do to become famous?
> Today, children have more ways to become famous than before. A big reason is social media.
First, they can become known through a skill. They can practice something like singing or dancing and share short videos of their progress. People like to watch improvement.
Second, they can join competitions or communities. For example, they might do sports events or game tournaments. If they perform well, they can get attention quickly.
But I think they should be careful. Fame can bring pressure and online criticism. Children also need adults to guide them and protect their privacy.
现在的孩子比以前有更多方式出名，社交媒体是一个很大的原因。
第一条路是靠技能出圈。比如练唱歌或跳舞，然后把作品或训练过程发成短视频，观众很喜欢看进步。
第二条路是参加比赛或圈子活动。比如运动比赛或游戏赛事，如果表现很好，就可能很快被关注。
但我觉得也要小心。名气会带来压力和网络吐槽，而且孩子更需要大人引导，并保护好隐私。

- What can children do with their fame?
> Children can use their fame as a resource. It can help them learn better and work in a safer way.
First, fame can give them access to better support. They may get a more professional team or better training. That helps them improve faster.
Fame can also help them choose better projects. For example, they may get chances to work with good directors or join higher-quality collaborations. This can build a stronger future.
But they need clear boundaries. Without guidance, children can be overworked or used for money. They can also be labeled too early, and that is hard to change later.
So fame is useful, but it must be managed. If it’s handled well, it becomes a boost, not a trap.
孩子可以把名气当成一种资源。它能帮他们得到更好的学习条件，也能让他们在更安全的方式下工作。
第一，名气能带来更好的支持系统。比如更专业的团队、更好的训练资源，这会让他们进步更快。
第二，名气也能帮助他们拿到更好的项目。比如有机会和更好的导演合作，或者参与质量更高的合作项目，这对未来积累很重要。
但前提是要有清晰的边界。没有大人引导，孩子可能被安排得太满，甚至被当成赚钱工具。也可能太早被贴标签，后面很难翻身。
所以名气是有用的，但一定要被管理好。处理得好，它是助推器；处理不好，它可能是陷阱。

- Do people become famous because of their talent?
> Sometimes people become famous because of talent, but not always. Talent is important, but it’s only one part.
Talent helps you stand out. It also helps you stay famous, because people keep coming back for your work.
But fame also needs exposure and timing. With social media, some people become famous quickly even without strong skills. A good team and smart marketing can also push someone into the spotlight.
For example, a truly talented singer can build fame step by step through good songs. On the other hand, some people go viral just because one short clip gets popular.
So I’d say talent affects how far you can go. Exposure affects how fast you become known.
有时候人是靠才华出名的，但不总是这样。才华很重要，但它只是其中一部分。
才华能让你更突出，也能让你更“站得住”。因为大家会为了你的作品反复回来。
但出名还需要曝光和时机。社交媒体时代，有些人即使能力一般，也可能因为一个视频就突然火了。团队运作和营销也会把人推到聚光灯下。
比如真正有实力的歌手，可以靠作品一步步积累名气；但也有人只是因为一个短视频爆红。
所以我觉得：才华决定你能走多远，曝光决定你火得多快。

- Is it easy to become famous in your country?
> I’d say it’s easier to get famous now, but it’s harder to stay famous.
There are so many platforms, and things spread really fast. One good video can blow up overnight. But there’s also a lot of content, so competition is huge and trends change quickly.
For example, you might see someone gain thousands of followers in a day. A week later, people move on to the next hot topic.
So yes, becoming famous can be easier than before. Staying relevant is the hard part. It usually takes consistent content and real skills.
我觉得现在“出名”更容易了，但“长期有名”反而更难。
平台太多，传播又很快，一个视频做得好就可能突然爆火。但同时内容也太多了，竞争很大，热度更新也特别快。
比如有些人短视频一夜涨粉，看起来很夸张。但过一阵子，大家又被新的热点带走，他的热度就下去了。
所以成名的门槛确实变低了，但稳定性也变差了。真正能长期保持名气的人其实不多。

- Do you want to be a famous person?
> Not really. I’d rather have some influence than be truly famous. I don’t want that level of attention.
If I became well-known, I’d lose a lot of privacy. People would watch what I do, and even small things could get judged.
Of course, fame has benefits. You get more resources, and your voice carries more weight. But it also comes with pressure, and it’s easy to be misunderstood.
So I’d prefer a quieter kind of success. I want to be respected in my own field, and I still want a normal life.
我其实不太想当很出名的人。我更想要一点影响力，但不想要那种高曝光。
如果真的很有名，隐私会少很多。你做什么都会被盯着，甚至一些小事也可能被放大和评价。
当然名气也有好处，比如资源更多，说话更有分量。但代价也明显，压力很大，而且很容易被误解。
所以我更想要一种“安静的成功”：在自己的领域被认可就行，同时还能过正常生活。

### 禁用手机的场合
- Describe an occasion when you were not allowed to use your mobile phone. 
  You should say: 
  When it was? 
  Where it was? 
  Why you were not allowed to use your mobile phone? 
  And how you felt about it? 
> Well, the specific occasion I'm thinking of was a classical symphony concert I attended last year at the Grand Theater. It's a common rule at such venues that mobile phones must be switched off or put on silent mode, and absolutely no photography or videography is allowed during the performance. I remember during the intermission, I briefly took out my phone to check a message, and immediately, an usher politely reminded me to put it away. Then, as the concert resumed, the orchestra played a particularly breathtaking piece, and I had this strong urge to capture the moment, to take a quick photo or a short video to remember the stunning performance and the grand atmosphere. However, knowing the rules, I resisted the temptation. While I understood and respected the policy, I have to admit, I felt a little bit of regret that I couldn't preserve that beautiful memory with a picture. It was a truly unforgettable experience, and I wished I could have had a visual souvenir.
> 嗯,我想到的具体场合是我去年在大剧院参加的一场古典交响乐音乐会。此类场所的普遍规定是必须关闭手机或置于静音模式,演出期间绝对不允许拍照或摄像。我记得在中场休息期间,我短暂地拿出手机查看了一条信息,立即,一位引座员礼貌地提醒我把它收起来。然后,随着音乐会继续进行,管弦乐队演奏了一首特别令人惊叹的曲子,我有一种强烈的冲动,想要捕捉这一刻,拍一张快速的照片或一段短视频来记住这场令人惊叹的表演和盛大的气氛。然而,知道规则,我抵制住了诱惑。虽然我理解并尊重这项政策,但我不得不承认,我感到有点遗憾,我不能用一张照片来保存那段美好的记忆。这是一次真正难忘的经历,我希望我能有一个视觉纪念品。

- How do young and old people use mobile phones differently?
> Young people usually use mobile phones more often. They also use them for more things.
For many young people, a phone is almost everything. They use it to chat, pay, study, and relax. For example, they may watch short videos and use mobile payment every day.
Older people often use phones in a simpler way. They mainly use them for calls, messages, and basic information. For example, they may call family members and check a family group chat.
Another difference is confidence. Young people are more willing to try new apps, so they learn faster. Older people may worry about making mistakes, so they prefer a few familiar functions.
年轻人一般用手机更频繁，而且用途也更多。
对很多年轻人来说，手机几乎就是“全能工具”。他们用它聊天、支付、学习、放松，比如每天刷短视频、用移动支付。
老年人用手机通常更简单一些。主要是打电话、发消息、看一些基本信息，比如给家里人打电话、看看家庭群消息。
还有一个差别是熟练度。年轻人更愿意尝试新软件，所以学得快；老年人可能怕点错、怕出问题，所以更喜欢用几个固定功能。

- What positive and negative impact do mobile phones have on friendship?
> They can increase contact, but they don’t always build a deeper bond.
On the positive side, phones make it easy to stay in touch. Friends can share small updates and talk anytime. This is especially helpful for long-distance friendships.
But there are downsides too. Messages are short and fast, so conversations can become shallow. Phones can also make people more sensitive. For example, if someone replies late, the other person may overthink it.
So it depends on habits. If people use phones to support friendship and still meet in real life, it helps. If phones become the main way of “being close”, the friendship can feel empty.
它能让联系变得更频繁，但不一定让关系更深。
正面来说，手机让保持联系很容易。朋友可以随时分享小事、想聊就聊，尤其对异地朋友特别有用。
但负面也很明显。聊天变得又短又快，所以很多对话会变浅。手机也会让人更敏感，比如对方回得慢一点，自己就容易想太多。
所以关键看使用习惯。如果手机只是补充，大家还愿意线下见面，那是加分；如果手机变成主要的“亲近方式”，友情就可能变空。

- Is it a waste of time to take pictures with mobile phones?
> I don’t think taking pictures with a phone is always a waste of time. It depends on how people do it.
If you take a few photos to save memories, it’s useful. You can look back later and remember the moment clearly. It’s also a nice way to share your life with friends.
But it can become a waste of time if people overdo it. For example, some people spend a long time taking food photos before they eat. They may also edit the photos again and again just to post them.
So I think the key is balance. Take some photos, then put the phone away. Enjoy the real moment.
我不觉得用手机拍照一定是浪费时间，关键还是看怎么拍。
如果只是拍几张用来记录回忆，那是有价值的。你以后翻出来会更容易记起当时的感觉，也能更方便和朋友分享生活。
但如果拍得太过头，就可能变成浪费时间。比如有些人吃饭前拍半天，还要反复修图，就为了发朋友圈。
所以我觉得重点是平衡。拍几张就好，然后把手机收起来，享受当下。

- Do you think it is necessary to have laws on the use of mobile phones?
> Yes, I think some laws are necessary for mobile phone use. But the laws should focus on high-risk situations.
Phones can cause real harm in certain cases. For example, using a phone while driving is dangerous, so strict rules make sense. Phones can also be used to invade privacy, like filming someone without permission.
At the same time, I don’t think the government should control everything. Phones are a basic tool for modern life, and people need freedom to use them normally.
So I think a balanced approach is best. Make clear laws for safety and privacy, and leave normal daily use to personal choice.
我觉得针对手机使用制定一些法律是有必要的，但重点应该放在高风险场景，而不是处处都管。
在某些情况下，手机确实会造成真实伤害。比如开车玩手机很危险，所以严格规定很合理。手机也可能被用来侵犯隐私，比如未经允许拍别人。
但同时我也不觉得政府应该什么都管。手机已经是现代生活的基础工具，大家也需要正常使用的自由。
所以我更支持一种平衡做法：在安全和隐私方面立清楚的规则，日常使用就交给个人选择。

- What are examples of good and poor phone manners?
> Good phone manners are basically about not bothering others. They’re also about respecting the people around you.
For example, it’s good to keep your phone on silent and reply briefly. If you need to take a call, it’s polite to say “Sorry, I need to take this,” and step aside. Poor manners would be playing videos on speaker in public or talking loudly. Another bad one is checking your phone nonstop when you’re with someone.
It really depends on the setting. In class, in meetings, or at the dinner table, you should be more careful. If it’s an emergency, it’s fine. You can just explain quickly.
In the end, good manners make people feel comfortable. Bad manners make people feel ignored, and that can easily hurt relationships.
我觉得好的手机礼仪，本质就是两点：别打扰别人，也别忽视你眼前的人。
比如好的做法是：把手机调静音、回消息尽量简短、真要接电话就先说一句“不好意思我得接一下”，然后走开一点。差的做法就是：公共场合外放刷视频、打电话很大声。还有一种很常见的是，跟人聊天一直低头玩手机。
这些其实很看场景。在课堂、会议、餐桌这种场合，更应该克制一点。当然如果是紧急情况也能理解，你解释一句就行。
总的来说，手机礼仪好，别人会更舒服，关系也更顺。礼仪差会让人觉得不被尊重，矛盾也更容易出来。

- How does the internet benefit people?
> I think the biggest benefit of the internet is convenience. It saves time and makes many things easier.
Because of that, people can get information and services quickly. It also gives them more choices, and sometimes it even lowers the cost.
It’s also great for learning and communication. You can look things up anytime, and you can stay connected with people in other cities.
For example, people can take online courses to learn new skills. They can also do daily tasks online, like ordering food or booking appointments.
我觉得互联网最大的好处就是方便，真的省时间，也让很多事情变简单。
因为这样一来，信息和各种服务都更容易拿到，速度也更快。选择也更多，有时候成本还会更低。
它对学习和沟通也很有帮助。你随时都能查资料，也能跟外地的人保持联系。
比如可以上网课学新技能，也可以线上处理很多日常事情，比如点外卖或者预约挂号。

### 为家人骄傲
- Describe a time when you felt proud of a family member. 
  You should say: 
  When it happened? 
  Who the person is? 
  What the person did? 
  And explain why you felt proud of him/her?
> Well, I'd like to talk about my grandfather, who I am incredibly proud of. He served our country on the border as a military doctor, saving lives during wartime and earning a third-class merit medal for his bravery and dedication. I mean, he literally risked his life on the battlefield, working under constant shelling to treat injured soldiers. This experience, and his actions, made me admire him even more, and I truly look up to him for his selflessness and courage.
> 好吧,我想谈谈我的祖父,我为他感到非常自豪。他作为军医在边境服役,在战时拯救了生命,并因其勇敢和奉献精神荣获三等功奖章。我的意思是,他确实冒着生命危险在战场上,在不断的炮击下工作来治疗受伤的士兵。这段经历和他的行为让我更加钦佩他,我真正钦佩他的无私和勇气。

- When would parents feel proud of their children?
> I think parents feel proud when their children become reliable. They feel it most when they can truly relax. They know their child is doing fine.
Good grades can make parents proud, of course. Winning a prize can do that too. But I think what matters more is attitude. Parents feel proud when a child takes responsibility and keeps improving. For example, when a child faces a problem and tries to fix it first, parents feel impressed. Also, when a child sticks to something for a long time and makes progress, parents feel really happy.
So for me, it’s not only about big results. It’s about growth. Parents feel proud when they see their child on the right track.
我觉得父母最骄傲的时候，是孩子变得可靠、让他们真正放心的时候。那种“我不用一直盯着”的踏实感，会让父母很自豪。
成绩好、拿奖当然也会让父母骄傲，但我觉得更重要的是态度。比如孩子遇到问题先自己想办法解决，而不是一出事就躲起来；再比如能长期坚持一件事，并且一点点进步。父母看到这种责任感和成长，就会特别开心。
所以我觉得这不只是“大结果”的问题，更是成长感。父母骄傲，是因为他们看到孩子在走正路。

- Should parents reward children? Why and how?
> Yes, I think parents should reward children sometimes. It can be a good way to encourage good habits. It also makes children feel seen. They know their effort matters.
But parents need to be careful. If rewards happen too often, kids may only work for the reward. They may stop doing the right thing when there is no prize. So I think rewards should focus on effort and progress, not only results.
As for how, it doesn’t have to be money. Simple praise works. Spending time together also works, like going out for a snack or doing a fun activity. Parents can also set small goals and give small rewards. That keeps it healthy. In the end, the reward should support good behaviour, not control it.
我觉得父母可以奖励孩子，但要讲方法，不然容易把孩子带成“只为奖品做事”。适当奖励确实能增加动力，也能让孩子感觉到：我的努力被看见了。
但奖励如果太频繁，孩子可能就只盯着奖励。没有奖品的时候，他就不愿意做正确的事了。所以我觉得奖励最好强调努力和进步，而不是只盯结果。
怎么奖励也不一定要给钱。口头表扬就很有效，陪伴也算奖励，比如一起去吃点小零食，或者做个孩子喜欢的活动。还可以设小目标配小奖励，让节奏更健康。最后奖励应该是帮助孩子养成好习惯，而不是用来“控制”孩子。

- Is it good to reward children too often? Why?
> I don’t think it’s good to reward children too often. If rewards become a habit, kids may start doing everything for a prize. They may stop caring about the task itself.
Over time, their inner motivation can get weaker. They may ask, “What do I get?” before they do anything. For example, some kids won’t do homework unless they get a gift. Some won’t help at home unless they get money. That’s not a healthy pattern.
So I think rewards should be used carefully. They should be occasional. They should also match effort and progress. In daily life, praise and attention are often enough. That helps children build good habits in a more natural way.
我觉得不太好，奖励太频繁会“变味”。如果奖励成了习惯，孩子可能就会把很多事情都当成“换奖品”，而不是觉得这件事本身值得做。
久了之后，内在动力会变弱。孩子可能会先问一句“我能得到什么”，才愿意去做。比如写作业一定要礼物，不给就不写；帮家里做点事也要钱，不给就不动。这种模式不太健康。
所以我更支持谨慎使用奖励，偶尔用、用得准，并且更强调努力和进步。平时很多时候表扬和关注就够了，这样更容易让孩子自然地养成好习惯。

- On what occasions would adults be proud of themselves?
> I think adults feel proud of themselves when they handle something difficult well. It often happens when they keep going under pressure. They don’t give up halfway.
Adults also feel proud when they stick to a goal for a long time. It shows discipline. It also shows growth. For example, someone may go through a stressful period at work and still finish an important task. Or they may learn a new skill and actually use it in real life.
Another common moment is taking responsibility. Adults feel proud when they solve problems instead of avoiding them. So overall, adults are proud when they see real progress. They also feel proud when they become more reliable.
我觉得成年人为自己骄傲，很多时候都跟“扛住”和“做到”有关。尤其是在压力很大的情况下，自己还能坚持下去，把事情处理好，这种成就感很强。
另外成年人也会为长期坚持而骄傲。因为这说明你有自律，也说明你在成长。比如工作压力很大的一段时间里，你还是把一个重要任务完成了；或者你学会了一个新技能，而且真的用到了生活或工作里。
还有一种很常见的情况是承担责任。成年人能直面问题、把问题解决掉，而不是逃避，这也会让人很自豪。所以总体来说，成年人的自豪感更像来自进步和责任感。

- Do rewards help a child become better?
> Yes, rewards can help a child become better. But it depends on how you use them.
A small reward can give kids a push to start. It also makes the goal feel more clear. This works well for younger children.
But if rewards are used too often, kids may do everything just for the prize. When the reward disappears, the effort can disappear too.
So rewards are fine as a tool. Parents should also praise effort and progress. Over time, they can reduce rewards and help the child build real habits.
我觉得奖励是有帮助的，但关键看你怎么用。
小奖励确实能让孩子更愿意开始做事，也能让目标更清楚。对年龄小的孩子尤其有效。
但如果奖励用得太频繁，孩子可能就变成“只为奖而做”。一旦没有奖励，他就不想做了。
所以奖励可以用，但它只是工具。父母还要多强调努力和进步。然后慢慢减少物质奖励，让孩子靠习惯和内在动力坚持下去。

- What do you think about children working hard just for grades?
> I don’t think it’s a great thing when kids work hard only for grades. Grades matter, but they shouldn’t be the only reason.
To be fair, grades are useful. They give a clear target, and they can open doors for schools and opportunities.
But if children study just to score, they often memorise without understanding. After the exam, they forget quickly. Some kids also become afraid of asking questions or trying harder problems, because they don’t want to lose points.
A better goal is to learn the skills and really understand the content. If that happens, good grades usually follow. And the child will be stronger in the long run.
我觉得孩子如果只是为了分数去拼命，其实不太好。分数重要，但不应该成为唯一理由。
当然我也承认，分数确实有用，它给了一个很清晰的目标，而且现实里也确实有门槛，很多机会看成绩。
但如果只为了拿高分，孩子很容易变成死记硬背，不求理解。考完就忘也很常见。还有些孩子会变得不敢提问、不敢挑战难题，因为怕扣分。
更好的目标是学懂、把能力练出来，分数只是结果。这样长期更抗压，也更容易走得远。
