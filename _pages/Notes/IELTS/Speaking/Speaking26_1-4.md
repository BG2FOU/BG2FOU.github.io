# Speaking2026年1-4月题库
## Part1
### View

- Do you prefer views in urban areas or in rural areas?
	- I definitely prefer views in rural areas. Natural landscapes like mountains and rivers give me a sense of peace and help me relax. Urban views can be impressive too, but they often feel crowded and repetitive to me.
- Do you like taking pictures of different views?
	- Yes, I enjoy capturing beautiful views with my phone camera, especially when I travel. It’s a simple way to preserve memories and share moments with friends. I don’t spend too much time editing though—I prefer keeping them natural.
- Do you prefer views in your own country or in other countries?
	- I appreciate both, but views in my own country feel more familiar and meaningful to me. Still, I find foreign landscapes incredibly fascinating because they offer new perspectives and cultural experiences.
- Do you usually look for a room with a good view when you travel?
	- If possible, I try to choose a room with a nice view, especially if it overlooks natural scenery. It makes my stay more enjoyable and memorable. However, if it’s too expensive, I don’t mind skipping it to save money.

### Life stage
- How do people remember each stage of their lives?
	- People often remember different stages through photographs, keepsakes, or significant milestones like graduations. Sharing stories with family and friends also helps keep memories alive. Personally, I sometimes reflect by looking back at old journals or social media posts.
- What did you often do with your friends in your childhood?
	- As a child, I used to play outdoor games like hide-and-seek or football with my friends in our neighborhood. We also enjoyed riding bicycles and exploring nearby parks together. Those simple activities created some of my happiest memories.
- What do you think is the most important at the moment?
	- Right now, I believe personal growth and maintaining a healthy work-life balance are most important. Focusing on my studies and well-being helps me stay motivated. Also, spending quality time with loved ones is something I truly value.
- Do you have any plans for the next five years?
	- Yes, I hope to complete my studies and gain some professional experience in my field. I also plan to improve my language skills and travel to a few new countries. Overall, I want to keep learning and exploring different opportunities.
- Do you enjoy being the age you are now?
	- Generally, yes—I appreciate the independence and opportunities that come with my current age. There are more responsibilities, of course, but I feel capable of shaping my own path. It’s a good balance between youth and maturity.
- At what age do you think people are the happiest?
	- I don’t believe there’s one specific age—happiness can come at any stage. Childhood is often carefree, while adulthood brings freedom and achievements. Many say retirement allows more time for hobbies and family. It really depends on the person and their circumstances.


### Building
- Are there tall buildings near your home?
	- Yes, there are several tall office buildings and apartment complexes in my neighborhood. They are mostly concentrated around the business district, which is about a ten-minute walk from my home. I often see their modern glass facades reflecting sunlight during the day.
- Do you take photos of buildings?
	- Sometimes, especially when I travel. I like photographing unique or historically significant buildings, like temples or modern landmarks. In daily life, though, I rarely take pictures of ordinary buildings unless the lighting or angle looks particularly striking.
- Is there a building that you would like to visit?
	- Yes, I’d love to visit the Eiffel Tower in Paris one day. It’s not only an iconic structure but also offers a breathtaking view of the city. Experiencing its history and design in person would be unforgettable.
- Do you want to live in a tall building?
	- I’m not sure—it depends. Living on a higher floor could provide nice views and more natural light. However, I might worry about relying too much on elevators or feeling isolated. For now, I prefer mid-rise apartments for a balance.

### Childhood activities

- What are your favourite activities?
  - Well, I’d say I really enjoy staying active and exploring new things. I often go hiking on weekends because it helps me relax in nature. Besides that, I like reading—especially non-fiction—and occasionally meeting friends for coffee or a meal.
- What were your favourite activities when you were a child?
  - When I was younger, I was very energetic and loved playing outdoors. I remember spending hours riding my bicycle around the neighbourhood with friends. I also enjoyed drawing and building things with blocks or Lego.
- Did you prefer to do activities alone or with a group of people when you were a child?
  - Actually, I mostly preferred being with other children. Group games like hide-and-seek were much more fun with friends. But sometimes, I also liked playing quietly by myself, especially when drawing or building something creative.
- Are there any difference between the activities you liked when you were a child and those you like now?
  - Yes, there are some clear differences. As a child, my activities were mostly about play and imagination, whereas now I lean toward hobbies that help me unwind or learn something new. Also, I’m more interested in solo or small-group activities now, rather than large, noisy games.

### Travel/Scenery

- Do you prefer the mountains or the sea?
  - That's a tough choice, but if I had to pick, I'd say the mountains. I find the fresh air and peaceful hiking trails incredibly refreshing. Though, I must admit, a day by the sea is also wonderful for its own sense of calm.
- Do you like to take scenery pictures?
  -  Yes, I do, but I'm not a professional. I often take quick photos on my phone when a view really strikes me—like a stunning sunset or a unique landscape. It's more about capturing a personal memory than perfect photography.
- Do you look out the window at the scenery when travelling by bus or car?
  - Absolutely, I almost always do. I find it relaxing to watch the world go by, especially on longer journeys through the countryside. It's a nice way to pass the time and sometimes spot interesting places.
- What are the most beautiful sights you have seen while traveling?
  - The most beautiful sight I've ever seen while traveling is the aurora borealis over the Hulunbuir Grassland. The colors of the aurora were incredibly vibrant, painting the night sky with hues of red, green and purple. It was an absolutely breathtaking experience that left me feeling completely awestruck and grateful.
