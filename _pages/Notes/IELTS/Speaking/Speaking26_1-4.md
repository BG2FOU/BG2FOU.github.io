# Speaking2026年1-4月题库
## Part1
### View

- Do you prefer views in urban areas or in rural areas?
	- I definitely prefer views in rural areas. Natural landscapes like mountains and rivers give me a sense of peace and help me relax. Urban views can be impressive too, but they often feel crowded and repetitive to me.
- Do you like taking pictures of different views?
	- Yes, I enjoy capturing beautiful views with my phone camera, especially when I travel. It’s a simple way to preserve memories and share moments with friends. I don’t spend too much time editing though—I prefer keeping them natural.
- Do you prefer views in your own country or in other countries?
	- I appreciate both, but views in my own country feel more familiar and meaningful to me. Still, I find foreign landscapes incredibly fascinating because they offer new perspectives and cultural experiences.
- Do you usually look for a room with a good view when you travel?
	- If possible, I try to choose a room with a nice view, especially if it overlooks natural scenery. It makes my stay more enjoyable and memorable. However, if it’s too expensive, I don’t mind skipping it to save money.

### Life stage
- How do people remember each stage of their lives?
	- People often remember different stages through photographs, keepsakes, or significant milestones like graduations. Sharing stories with family and friends also helps keep memories alive. Personally, I sometimes reflect by looking back at old journals or social media posts.
- What did you often do with your friends in your childhood?
	- As a child, I used to play outdoor games like hide-and-seek or football with my friends in our neighborhood. We also enjoyed riding bicycles and exploring nearby parks together. Those simple activities created some of my happiest memories.
- What do you think is the most important at the moment?
	- Right now, I believe personal growth and maintaining a healthy work-life balance are most important. Focusing on my studies and well-being helps me stay motivated. Also, spending quality time with loved ones is something I truly value.
- Do you have any plans for the next five years?
	- Yes, I hope to complete my studies and gain some professional experience in my field. I also plan to improve my language skills and travel to a few new countries. Overall, I want to keep learning and exploring different opportunities.
- Do you enjoy being the age you are now?
	- Generally, yes—I appreciate the independence and opportunities that come with my current age. There are more responsibilities, of course, but I feel capable of shaping my own path. It’s a good balance between youth and maturity.
- At what age do you think people are the happiest?
	- I don’t believe there’s one specific age—happiness can come at any stage. Childhood is often carefree, while adulthood brings freedom and achievements. Many say retirement allows more time for hobbies and family. It really depends on the person and their circumstances.


### Building
- Are there tall buildings near your home?
	- Yes, there are several tall office buildings and apartment complexes in my neighborhood. They are mostly concentrated around the business district, which is about a ten-minute walk from my home. I often see their modern glass facades reflecting sunlight during the day.
- Do you take photos of buildings?
	- Sometimes, especially when I travel. I like photographing unique or historically significant buildings, like temples or modern landmarks. In daily life, though, I rarely take pictures of ordinary buildings unless the lighting or angle looks particularly striking.
- Is there a building that you would like to visit?
	- Yes, I’d love to visit the Eiffel Tower in Paris one day. It’s not only an iconic structure but also offers a breathtaking view of the city. Experiencing its history and design in person would be unforgettable.
- Do you want to live in a tall building?
	- I’m not sure—it depends. Living on a higher floor could provide nice views and more natural light. However, I might worry about relying too much on elevators or feeling isolated. For now, I prefer mid-rise apartments for a balance.

### Childhood activities

- What are your favourite activities?
  - Well, I’d say I really enjoy staying active and exploring new things. I often go hiking on weekends because it helps me relax in nature. Besides that, I like reading—especially non-fiction—and occasionally meeting friends for coffee or a meal.
- What were your favourite activities when you were a child?
  - When I was younger, I was very energetic and loved playing outdoors. I remember spending hours riding my bicycle around the neighbourhood with friends. I also enjoyed drawing and building things with blocks or Lego.
- Did you prefer to do activities alone or with a group of people when you were a child?
  - Actually, I mostly preferred being with other children. Group games like hide-and-seek were much more fun with friends. But sometimes, I also liked playing quietly by myself, especially when drawing or building something creative.
- Are there any difference between the activities you liked when you were a child and those you like now?
  - Yes, there are some clear differences. As a child, my activities were mostly about play and imagination, whereas now I lean toward hobbies that help me unwind or learn something new. Also, I’m more interested in solo or small-group activities now, rather than large, noisy games.

### Travel/Scenery

- Do you prefer the mountains or the sea?
  - That's a tough choice, but if I had to pick, I'd say the mountains. I find the fresh air and peaceful hiking trails incredibly refreshing. Though, I must admit, a day by the sea is also wonderful for its own sense of calm.
- Do you like to take scenery pictures?
  -  Yes, I do, but I'm not a professional. I often take quick photos on my phone when a view really strikes me—like a stunning sunset or a unique landscape. It's more about capturing a personal memory than perfect photography.
- Do you look out the window at the scenery when travelling by bus or car?
  - Absolutely, I almost always do. I find it relaxing to watch the world go by, especially on longer journeys through the countryside. It's a nice way to pass the time and sometimes spot interesting places.
- What are the most beautiful sights you have seen while traveling?
  - The most beautiful sight I've ever seen while traveling is the aurora borealis over the Hulunbuir Grassland. The colors of the aurora were incredibly vibrant, painting the night sky with hues of red, green and purple. It was an absolutely breathtaking experience that left me feeling completely awestruck and grateful.

### 近期观影

I watched it recently at home, actually, just last weekend, on a cozy Saturday evening. It's essentially a captivating mystery story about Sherlock Holmes investigating a legendary curse and a mysterious death on the gloomy moors of Dartmoor.

### 朋友学的技能

- Well, I'd like to talk about one of my university roommates, Noble, who's not just a friend but also someone I deeply admire for his unique hobbies and dedication. He's always been the kind of person who dives deep into his interests, and that's exactly what he did with this particular skill. The skill he picked up is amateur radio communication, often known as 'ham radio'. It's essentially about using various radio frequency bands to communicate globally, which sounds quite technical, but Noble made it fascinating. He learned it from an older, experienced ham radio operator he met through an online forum, not in a formal classroom setting. The core story behind his learning journey is quite remarkable. He spent months meticulously building his own Yagi antenna from scratch, which is a directional antenna. Then, he managed to make contact with a Japanese friend through a repeater on the International Space Station. Imagine the thrill of that! It wasn't just about talking; it was about overcoming technical challenges and connecting across vast distances using self-made equipment. This skill has had a profound impact on him. It not only honed his technical problem-solving abilities but also broadened his perspective on global communication and cultural exchange. He's become more patient, detail-oriented, and has even inspired others, including myself, to explore unconventional hobbies. It's truly shaped who he is today, making him a more well-rounded and interesting individual.



### 机智解决问题的人



### 商场



### 对家庭重要的东西

- Well, an important item that has been kept in my family for a long time is actually my grandfather's third-class merit medal. It's something we all cherish deeply. This medal is quite special, you know, not just because of its age, but also due to the intricate patterns engraved on it. It depicts a soldier standing firm, with a star above, symbolizing honor and bravery. The story behind this medal is truly inspiring. My grandfather, who served as a military doctor, earned it for his selfless dedication in saving lives during a border defense battle. He worked tirelessly, often under extremely dangerous conditions, to tend to the wounded. For me, this medal holds immense emotional value. It constantly reminds me of his courage and resilience, and it motivates me to strive for excellence in my own life, whatever challenges I may face. It's a symbol of our family's heritage and a source of great pride.

### 常做计划的人

- Well, the person I'd like to talk about is one of my university roommates, actually my best friend, named Noble. We lived together for four years during our undergraduate studies. He is, by nature, an incredibly organized and meticulous person. He always has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve and how to get there. The most impressive plan he ever made, and one that really stuck with me, was his comprehensive career development plan. This wasn't just a vague idea; it was a detailed roadmap he created during our final year at university, outlining his goals for the next five to ten years. I remember being absolutely amazed by his foresight and dedication. His plan covered everything from the specific skills he needed to acquire, to the companies he wanted to work for, and even the certifications he aimed to get. Witnessing his methodical approach truly inspired me to think more strategically about my own future, and I've tried to adopt some of his planning habits ever since.

### 想拥有的科技产品

- Well, if I had to pick a piece of technology I'd really like to own, it would definitely be a home NAS, or Network Attached Storage. I mean, it's something I've been considering for a while now. This isn't just any external hard drive; it's a dedicated device that connects to my home network, offering a centralized location for all my digital files. The main draw for me is its massive storage capacity, which can be expanded as needed, and the ability to access my data from anywhere with an internet connection. You know, in this digital age, we accumulate so many precious memories – photos, videos, important documents. My current setup involves multiple external drives, and honestly, it's a bit of a mess. A NAS would streamline this entirely, acting as a reliable backup system for all those irreplaceable moments, ensuring they're safe and sound. Ultimately, owning a NAS would bring me a profound sense of peace of mind. The thought of losing years of family photos or crucial work files is quite daunting, so having a robust, automated backup solution would alleviate that anxiety significantly. It's not just about storage; it's about safeguarding my digital life and feeling secure.

### 外国的短期停留

- Well, that's an interesting question. If I had the opportunity to choose a short-term job in a foreign country, I would definitely opt for a volunteer position. More specifically, I'm talking about volunteering at a major international sporting event, like the Olympics or a World Cup, which I think would be an absolutely incredible experience. My primary motivation for wanting to do this is to immerse myself in a different culture and gain a unique perspective on how such large-scale events are organized. You know, I actually had a taste of this kind of work when I volunteered at the Asian Winter Games a few years ago. My role then was to welcome international delegations at the airport, which was really rewarding. I anticipate that this kind of volunteer work would be incredibly fulfilling, not just because of the chance to contribute to a global event, but also because I'm confident I'd learn a tremendous amount of new things, from cross-cultural communication skills to problem-solving in a dynamic environment. It's the satisfaction of growth and connection that truly appeals to me.



### 给别人建议

- Well, I remember a particular time when a good friend of mine was really struggling with his academic path. He was feeling quite stuck, you know, at a crossroads with his studies. This happened last semester, actually, when we were both in our second year of university. He was facing a major decision about his specialization, which was causing him a lot of stress and uncertainty. I advised him to thoroughly research the job market and future career prospects related to different specializations. I suggested he look into what skills were in demand and how various fields were evolving, rather than just focusing on his immediate interests. I also encouraged him to talk to alumni who were already working in those areas. After taking my advice, he spent a good few weeks diving deep into research and networking. This really helped him gain a clearer perspective on his options. Ultimately, he chose a specialization that aligned well with future opportunities, and he's now much more confident and motivated in his studies. It was great to see him find his direction.

### 完美工作

- Well, the perfect job I'd absolutely love to have in the future is to be a satellite attitude and orbit control subsystem designer. This role primarily involves designing and optimizing satellite orbits, which is a highly specialized and technical field. What truly attracts me to this position is the incredible opportunity to contribute to major national projects. Imagine being part of something that pushes the boundaries of space exploration and technology! For me, this job isn't just about a career; it's about making a tangible contribution to my country's progress and scientific advancement. It's a profound sense of purpose that goes beyond personal achievement.

### 想见的名人

- Well, the famous person I'd really like to meet is Fan Zhendong, who is a world-renowned table tennis player from China. He's known for his incredibly confident and dominant playing style, which I find really captivating to watch. One particular moment that really stands out to me is when he won the Olympic gold medal. It was such an inspiring display of skill and determination. I'd love to meet him primarily because I deeply admire his achievements and his unwavering dedication to his sport. I think it would be fascinating to hear about his journey firsthand.

### 禁用手机的场合

- Well, the specific occasion I'm thinking of was a classical symphony concert I attended last year at the Grand Theater. It's a common rule at such venues that mobile phones must be switched off or put on silent mode, and absolutely no photography or videography is allowed during the performance. I remember during the intermission, I briefly took out my phone to check a message, and immediately, an usher politely reminded me to put it away. Then, as the concert resumed, the orchestra played a particularly breathtaking piece, and I had this strong urge to capture the moment, to take a quick photo or a short video to remember the stunning performance and the grand atmosphere. However, knowing the rules, I resisted the temptation. While I understood and respected the policy, I have to admit, I felt a little bit of regret that I couldn't preserve that beautiful memory with a picture. It was a truly unforgettable experience, and I wished I could have had a visual souvenir.

### 为家人骄傲

- Well, I'd like to talk about my grandfather, who I am incredibly proud of. He served our country on the border as a military doctor, saving lives during wartime and earning a third-class merit medal for his bravery and dedication. I mean, he literally risked his life on the battlefield, working under constant shelling to treat injured soldiers. This experience, and his actions, made me admire him even more, and I truly look up to him for his selflessness and courage.
