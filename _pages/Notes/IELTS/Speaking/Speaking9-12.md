# Speaking 9-12月题库
## Part1
### Plants

- Do you keep plants at home?
  - Yes, I definitely do. I have a few small potted plants on my windowsill, mostly succulents and a snake plant. I chose them because they're low-maintenance and quite hard to kill. I also think they make my living space feel more fresh and alive.
- What plant did you grow when you were young?
  - I remember growing sunflowers when I was in primary school. It was a class project, and we planted the seeds in little pots. I was so excited to water it every day and watch it sprout and grow taller than me. It was a very rewarding experience that taught me a bit about patience.
- Do you know anything about growing a plant?
  - I know the basics. For instance, I understand that most plants need three key things: sunlight, water, and good soil. However, I've learned that overwatering is a common mistake, as it can cause the roots to rot. I'm not an expert, but I can keep a few resilient plants alive and healthy.
- Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?
  - Yes, it's a fairly common practice, especially for certain occasions. Plants like orchids or lucky bamboo are very popular gifts. They are often given for housewarmings, business openings, or during the New Year because they symbolize good fortune, prosperity, and growth. It's a thoughtful gift that represents good wishes.

### Art

- Do you like art?
  - Yes, I'm quite fond of art. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I really appreciate how it can express emotions and ideas. I particularly enjoy looking at paintings and digital art in my free time.
- Do you like visiting art gallerties?
  - Absolutely, I find it a very relaxing and inspiring experience. Whenever I travel to a new city, I try to visit a local gallery or museum. It's a great way to learn about the local culture and see something beautiful.
- Do you want to be an artist?
  - Not really. While I deeply admire artistic talent, I don't think I have the necessary creativity or skill. I prefer to enjoy art as a hobby and a viewer rather than as a creator.
- Do you like modern art or traditional art?
  - I appreciate both, but if I had to choose, I'd say I'm more drawn to traditional art. I love the classic techniques and the historical stories behind paintings from the Renaissance era. However, I do find some modern art installations very thought-provoking.
- Can you tell me about a specific artwork or artisit that has inspired you?
  - Certainly! An artist who consistently inspires me is Van Gogh. Although I've never seen his works in person, reproductions of "The Starry Night" resonate deeply. Beyond its beauty, the tumultuous sky mirrors his life's struggles. He alchemized profound emotional turmoil into a uniquely expressive style tragically underappreciated during his time, yet celebrated now.
