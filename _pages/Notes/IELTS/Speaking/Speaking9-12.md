# Speaking 9-12月题库
## Part1
### Plants

- Do you keep plants at home?
  - Yes, I definitely do. I have a few small potted plants on my windowsill, mostly succulents and a snake plant. I chose them because they're low-maintenance and quite hard to kill. I also think they make my living space feel more fresh and alive.
- What plant did you grow when you were young?
  - I remember growing sunflowers when I was in primary school. It was a class project, and we planted the seeds in little pots. I was so excited to water it every day and watch it sprout and grow taller than me. It was a very rewarding experience that taught me a bit about patience.
- Do you know anything about growing a plant?
  - I know the basics. For instance, I understand that most plants need three key things: sunlight, water, and good soil. However, I've learned that overwatering is a common mistake, as it can cause the roots to rot. I'm not an expert, but I can keep a few resilient plants alive and healthy.
- Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?
  - Yes, it's a fairly common practice, especially for certain occasions. Plants like orchids or lucky bamboo are very popular gifts. They are often given for housewarmings, business openings, or during the New Year because they symbolize good fortune, prosperity, and growth. It's a thoughtful gift that represents good wishes.

### Art

- Do you like art?
  - Yes, I'm quite fond of art. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I really appreciate how it can express emotions and ideas. I particularly enjoy looking at paintings and digital art in my free time.
- Do you like visiting art gallerties?
  - Absolutely, I find it a very relaxing and inspiring experience. Whenever I travel to a new city, I try to visit a local gallery or museum. It's a great way to learn about the local culture and see something beautiful.
- Do you want to be an artist?
  - Not really. While I deeply admire artistic talent, I don't think I have the necessary creativity or skill. I prefer to enjoy art as a hobby and a viewer rather than as a creator.
- Do you like modern art or traditional art?
  - I appreciate both, but if I had to choose, I'd say I'm more drawn to traditional art. I love the classic techniques and the historical stories behind paintings from the Renaissance era. However, I do find some modern art installations very thought-provoking.
- Can you tell me about a specific artwork or artisit that has inspired you?
  - Certainly! An artist who consistently inspires me is Van Gogh. Although I've never seen his works in person, reproductions of "The Starry Night" resonate deeply. Beyond its beauty, the tumultuous sky mirrors his life's struggles. He alchemized profound emotional turmoil into a uniquely expressive style tragically underappreciated during his time, yet celebrated now.

### Growing vegetables/fruits

- Is growing vegetables popular in your country?
  - Yes, it's quite popular, especially in rural areas where many people have their own gardens. In recent years, it has also become a growing trend in urban areas with the popularity of balcony gardening. It's seen as a healthy and rewarding hobby.

- Do many people grow vegetables in your city?
  - In my city, which is quite urban, it's not common for everyone to have a garden. However, you can find community gardens in some neighbourhoods, and many residents grow small plants like herbs or tomatoes on their balconies.

- Do you think it's easy to grow vegetables?
  - It really depends on the type of vegetable. Some, like tomatoes or lettuce, are relatively easy for beginners. Others can be quite challenging and require specific knowledge about soil, sunlight, and pests. So, it's a learning process.

- Should schools teach students how to grow vegetables?
  - Absolutely, I think it's a fantastic idea. It would teach children valuable lessons about where their food comes from, patience, and responsibility. It could also encourage healthier eating habits and an appreciation for nature.

- Are you interested in growing vegetables and fruits?
  - Yes, I'm quite interested. I've tried growing some basil and chili peppers on my windowsill. I find it very relaxing and satisfying to be able to eat something I've nurtured myself. I'd love to have a proper garden someday.


### Museum

- Do you think museums are important?
  - Yes, absolutely. I believe museums are vital as they preserve our cultural heritage and history for future generations. They provide a space for education and inspiration, allowing people to learn about art, science, and history in an engaging way. Furthermore, they play a key role in bringing communities together.

- Are there many museums in your hometown?
  - My hometown is a medium-sized city, so we have a few museums, but not a huge number. The most prominent one is a natural museum that shows messages about local volcano. They are quite popular and often host school trips and local events.

- Do you often visit a museum?
  - Not as often as I'd like to, to be honest. I usually visit a museum when I'm travelling to a new city, as I enjoy exploring their local exhibitions. In my daily life, I tend to go only when there's a special exhibition that catches my interest.

- When was the last time you visited a museum?
  - The last time I visited a museum was about two months ago. I went to Beijing and spent an afternoon at their radio history museum, which had a fascinating exhibition on amateur radio equipments. It was a really enjoyable and educational experience.


### Advertisement

- Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?
  - Yes, definitely. I vividly remember a public service advertisement about protecting the environment. It showed a crying polar bear on a melting iceberg, which really shocked me as a child. It made me aware of climate change for the first time, and that message has stuck with me ever since.

- Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport?
  - Oh, absolutely. Public transport is filled with ads, especially in trains and buses. You see posters above the seats, digital screens near the doors, and even advertisements on the tickets. It's almost impossible to avoid them during a commute.

- Do you like advertisements?
  - It really depends. I appreciate creative and entertaining ads that tell a story or make me laugh. However, I find most ads repetitive and intrusive, especially online pop-ups. So, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with them.

- What kind of advertising do you like?
  - I particularly like humorous or emotionally touching ads, such as those from brands like Coca-Cola or Apple. They focus on storytelling rather than just pushing a product. Also, I prefer short, clever video ads that get straight to the point without wasting time.


### Borrowing/lending

- Have you borrowed books from others?
  - Yes, I have. I often borrow books from my friends, especially when we’re studying the same subject. It’s a great way to share knowledge and save money. Plus, it gives us something interesting to discuss later.

- Have you ever borrowed money from others?
  - Yes, but only on rare occasions for small amounts. For example, if I forget my wallet when going out with friends, I might borrow some cash to pay for lunch. I always make sure to pay them back as soon as possible.

- Do you like to lending things to others?
  - Generally, I don’t mind lending things to people I trust. If a close friend needs something, like a book or class notes, I’m happy to help. But I prefer to avoid lending valuable items, just to be safe.

- How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?
  - It’s a bit frustrating, especially if the item was important to me. I try to give gentle reminders, but I also understand that people can forget. In the end, it’s taught me to be more careful about what I lend out.
