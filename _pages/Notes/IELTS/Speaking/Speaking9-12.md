# Speaking 9-12月题库
## Part1
### Plants

- Do you keep plants at home?
  - Yes, I definitely do. I have a few small potted plants on my windowsill, mostly succulents and a snake plant. I chose them because they're low-maintenance and quite hard to kill. I also think they make my living space feel more fresh and alive.
- What plant did you grow when you were young?
  - I remember growing sunflowers when I was in primary school. It was a class project, and we planted the seeds in little pots. I was so excited to water it every day and watch it sprout and grow taller than me. It was a very rewarding experience that taught me a bit about patience.
- Do you know anything about growing a plant?
  - I know the basics. For instance, I understand that most plants need three key things: sunlight, water, and good soil. However, I've learned that overwatering is a common mistake, as it can cause the roots to rot. I'm not an expert, but I can keep a few resilient plants alive and healthy.
- Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?
  - Yes, it's a fairly common practice, especially for certain occasions. Plants like orchids or lucky bamboo are very popular gifts. They are often given for housewarmings, business openings, or during the New Year because they symbolize good fortune, prosperity, and growth. It's a thoughtful gift that represents good wishes.

### Art

- Do you like art?
  - Yes, I'm quite fond of art. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I really appreciate how it can express emotions and ideas. I particularly enjoy looking at paintings and digital art in my free time.
- Do you like visiting art gallerties?
  - Absolutely, I find it a very relaxing and inspiring experience. Whenever I travel to a new city, I try to visit a local gallery or museum. It's a great way to learn about the local culture and see something beautiful.
- Do you want to be an artist?
  - Not really. While I deeply admire artistic talent, I don't think I have the necessary creativity or skill. I prefer to enjoy art as a hobby and a viewer rather than as a creator.
- Do you like modern art or traditional art?
  - I appreciate both, but if I had to choose, I'd say I'm more drawn to traditional art. I love the classic techniques and the historical stories behind paintings from the Renaissance era. However, I do find some modern art installations very thought-provoking.
- Can you tell me about a specific artwork or artisit that has inspired you?
  - Certainly! An artist who consistently inspires me is Van Gogh. Although I've never seen his works in person, reproductions of "The Starry Night" resonate deeply. Beyond its beauty, the tumultuous sky mirrors his life's struggles. He alchemized profound emotional turmoil into a uniquely expressive style tragically underappreciated during his time, yet celebrated now.

### Having a break

- How often do you take a rest or a break?
  - I try to take short breaks every couple of hours, especially when I'm studying or working. It's important to pause and recharge to maintain productivity. I usually have a longer rest period in the evening to fully unwind.

- What do you usually do when you are resting?
  - It depends, but I often listen to music or watch an episode of a light-hearted TV show. Sometimes I'll just scroll through social media or have a quick chat with a family member. The key for me is to do something that takes my mind off work completely.

- Do you take a nap when you are taking your rest?
  - Occasionally, but it's not a daily habit for me. I only take a nap if I'm feeling exceptionally tired or didn't get enough sleep the night before. I try to keep it short, around 20 minutes, to avoid feeling groggy afterwards.

- How do you feel after taking a nap?
  - If it's a short power nap, I usually feel refreshed and more alert, ready to focus on my tasks again. However, if I nap for too long, I sometimes feel even more drowsy and disoriented. So, I find the length of the nap is really crucial to how I feel afterward.


### Sharing

- Did your parents teach you to share when you were a child?
  - Absolutely, my parents placed a big emphasis on sharing from a very young age. They taught me to share my toys with my siblings and friends during playdates. It was a fundamental value in our household to be generous and considerate of others.

- What kind of things do you like to share with others?
  - I really enjoy sharing food, like a delicious dessert or a snack, with my friends. I also like sharing interesting articles or videos I find online. It’s a great way to start a conversation and connect over something enjoyable.

- What kind of things are not suitable for sharing?
  - I believe personal belongings like toothbrushes or passwords are definitely not suitable for sharing. Also, I think it's unwise to share confidential information or gossip about someone else. Protecting your own and others' privacy is very important.

- Do you have anything to share with others recently?
  - Yes, just recently I shared some exciting news about a promotion I got at work with my close friends. I also shared a fantastic new book I finished reading by lending it to my colleague. It was a gripping novel that I thought she'd love too.

- Who is the first person you would like to share good news with?
  - Without a doubt, my mother is always the first person I want to tell. She's my biggest supporter and is always genuinely happy for my achievements. Sometimes, if it's news about friends, I might share it with my best friend first.

- What kind of news do you share with your friend?
  - I mostly share positive news, like personal achievements or fun plans for the future. For instance, I’d tell them about a upcoming trip or a success I had at university. We also share smaller, funny things that happen in our daily lives.


### Doing something well

- Do you have an experience that you did something well?
  - Yes, I do. I once developed a small web application for our university's volunteer association to help them manage their activities and members more efficiently. I was solely responsible for the entire project, from design to coding and deployment. Although it was a simple application, it worked smoothly and was well-received by the volunteers. I felt a great sense of accomplishment because my skills created something genuinely useful for others.

- Do you have an experience that your teacher thought you did a good job?
  - Certainly. In my final year at university, I did a research project on non-cooperative target recognition, which was quite challenging. I spent a lot of time on it and presented my findings to my professor. He was quite impressed with the depth of my research and the innovative methods I used. He praised my hard work and analytical skills, which was incredibly encouraging and made all the effort feel worthwhile.

- Do you often tell your friends when they do something well?
  - Absolutely. I believe it's very important to acknowledge the efforts and achievements of my friends. For example, if a friend delivers a great presentation or creates a beautiful piece of art, I'll be the first to compliment them. It’s not about flattery, but about offering genuine support and encouragement. I think celebrating each other's successes is a key part of a strong and healthy friendship.

- How do you feel when someone praises you for doing something well?
  - I feel really happy and motivated when someone praises my work. It’s a wonderful feeling to know that my hard work has been noticed and appreciated by others. It definitely boosts my confidence and inspires me to take on new challenges and continue to improve myself. While I can be a little shy at times, the positive feeling of being valued is always very encouraging.


### Shoes

- Do you like buying shoes? How often?
  - Absolutely, I do enjoy buying shoes. However, I wouldn't say I'm an obsessive shopper. I probably buy a new pair every few months, or whenever I need something specific for a new season or a particular occasion.

- Have you ever bought shoes online?
  - Yes, I have purchased shoes online on several occasions. It's incredibly convenient to browse through countless styles from home. But I'm a bit cautious about sizing, so I prefer to stick to brands whose fit I'm already familiar with.

- How much money do you usually spend on shoes?
  - It really depends on the type of shoe. For everyday sneakers, I might spend around [100-300 RMB]. However, for a high-quality pair of boots or formal shoes that will last for years, I'm willing to invest more, perhaps up to [600 RMB] or so.

- Which do you prefer, fashionable shoes or comfortable shoes?
  - Without a doubt, I prioritise comfort. There's no point in wearing stylish shoes if you're in pain all day. That said, I always try to find a pair that offers a good balance – something that is both comfortable and has a design I like.


### Rules

- Are there any rules for students at your school?
  - Yes, definitely. Like most schools, we have a number of rules to maintain order. For instance, there are strict rules about punctuality, attendance, and wearing a uniform. We're also expected to be respectful to both teachers and fellow students.

- Do you think students would benefit more from more rules?
  - Not necessarily. I believe we already have a sufficient number of essential rules. While rules are important for safety and structure, too many can feel restrictive and might stifle students' independence and creativity. It's about finding a healthy balance.

- Do you have a teacher who does his or her job very well?
  - Absolutely. My history teacher stands out because she is incredibly passionate. She doesn't just read from the textbook; she uses engaging stories and debates to make the subject come alive. Her dedication truly inspires us to learn.

- Do you think school rules are generally fair?
  - For the most part, yes, I do. I think the main rules are designed to be fair and to create a positive environment for everyone. However, there might be an occasional minor rule that seems a bit outdated or unnecessary, but overall, the system is quite just.


### Public places

- Have you ever talked with someone you don't know in public places?
  - Yes, occasionally. For example, I once chatted with a tourist who asked for directions at a subway station. We ended up discussing local attractions, and it was quite pleasant. However, such interactions are rare unless there’s a specific reason to start a conversation.

- Do you wear headphones in public places?
  - Absolutely. I often wear headphones when commuting or in crowded areas like cafes. They help me focus on music or podcasts while blocking out background noise. Plus, it subtly signals that I’m occupied, which avoids unnecessary interruptions.

- Would you like to see more public places near where you live?
  - Definitely. I’d love to have more green spaces, like parks or community gardens, in my neighborhood. They’d provide residents with areas to relax, exercise, and socialize. Additionally, a modern public library or cultural center would greatly benefit our community.

- Do you prefer indoor or outdoor public spaces?
  - I generally prefer outdoor spaces, especially parks or waterfront areas, because they offer fresh air and natural scenery. However, indoor spaces like museums or libraries are also appealing for their quiet and comfortable environments. It really depends on my mood and the weather.

- Are public places in your city usually crowded?
  - It varies. Popular spots like downtown shopping districts or transit hubs tend to be crowded, especially during weekends or rush hours. But there are also quieter public areas, like local parks or less central cafes, where you can avoid large crowds.


### Crowded place

- Is the city where you live crowded?
  - Overall, I would say it is quite crowded, especially in the city center and during peak hours. The public transport and main shopping streets are often packed with people. However, the residential area where I live is relatively peaceful and not as busy.

- Is there a crowded place near where you live?
  - Yes, there is a large shopping mall about a ten-minute walk from my apartment. It's always bustling with shoppers, particularly on weekends and during holiday seasons. The food court and cinema there are especially packed in the evenings.

- Do you like crowded places?
  - Not particularly, to be honest. I find large crowds can be a bit overwhelming and stressful at times. I prefer quieter, more spacious environments where I can relax and think clearly. Although, I don't mind a lively atmosphere occasionally, like at a concert or festival.

- Do most people like crowded places?
  - I think it really depends on the person and the situation. Some people thrive in busy, social environments like night markets or sporting events. However, many others, especially those who seek peace or need to focus, tend to avoid them. It's really a matter of personal preference.

- When was the last time you were in a crowded place?
  - The last time was just a few days ago. I went to the central train station to meet a friend arriving from another city. It was extremely crowded with commuters during the evening rush hour, making it a bit difficult to navigate through the crowd.


### Staying with old people

- Have you ever worked with old people?
  - Yes, I have. I once volunteered at a community centre where I helped organise weekly social activities for elderly residents. I assisted with setting up events and sometimes just chatted with them over tea. It was a very rewarding experience that gave me a new perspective.

- Are you happy to work with people who are older than you?
  - Absolutely, I'm very happy to. I find that older colleagues often have a wealth of experience and knowledge that I can learn from. They usually offer valuable advice and a different, more patient perspective on problem-solving.

- What are the benefits of being friend or working with old people?
  - The main benefits are gaining wisdom and life lessons that you can't find in textbooks. They often have fascinating stories and a calmer, more measured approach to challenges. Furthermore, they can offer tremendous emotional support and guidance.

- Do you enjoy spending time with old people?
  - Yes, I genuinely do. I regularly visit my grandparents and always enjoy hearing their stories about the past. I find their company calming and their advice incredibly insightful, which makes the time spent with them both enjoyable and enriching.


### Going out

- Do you bring food or snacks with you when going out?
  - Yes, I often do, especially if I'm going to be out for a long time. I usually pack some fruit or a granola bar to avoid buying expensive or unhealthy snacks while I'm out. It's a habit that helps me save money and also ensures I have something healthy to eat.

- Do you always take your mobile phone with you when going out?
  - Absolutely, I never leave home without it. My phone is essential for navigation, communication, and paying for things. It also gives me peace of mind knowing I can call for help in case of an emergency.

- Do you prefer going out alone or with friends?
  - It really depends on my purpose. If I need to run errands or focus, like shopping for something specific, I prefer going alone. However, for social activities like seeing a movie or having dinner, I definitely enjoy going with friends more.

- What do you usually do when you go out on weekends?
  - On weekends, I often go out to relax and socialize. I might meet friends for coffee, go shopping, or see a film. Sometimes, I prefer to visit a park or a museum for a more quiet and cultural experience.


### Chatting

- Do you like chatting with friends?
  - Absolutely, I really enjoy catching up with my friends. It’s a great way to relax and share what’s going on in our lives. Whether it’s something exciting or just daily updates, it always makes me feel more connected.

- What do you usually chat about with friends?
  - We mostly talk about everyday things like work, studies, or hobbies. Sometimes we discuss movies or music we’ve recently discovered. And of course, we often share funny stories or personal experiences.

- Do you prefer to chat with a group of people or with only one friend?
  - It depends on the situation, but I generally prefer one-on-one conversations. They feel more personal and meaningful, and it’s easier to talk about things in depth. Group chats are fun too, especially when we're making plans or just having laughs.

- Do you prefer to communicate face-to-face or via social media?
  - I definitely prefer face-to-face communication when possible. It feels more genuine and you can pick up on body language and tone. That said, social media is super convenient for staying in touch with friends who are far away.

- Do you argue with friends?
  - Occasionally, yes, but it’s usually over small things like where to eat or what movie to watch. I try to keep things respectful and listen to their perspective. In the end, we always find a way to sort it out and stay friends.


### Growing vegetables/fruits

- Is growing vegetables popular in your country?
  - Yes, it's quite popular, especially in rural areas where many people have their own gardens. In recent years, it has also become a growing trend in urban areas with the popularity of balcony gardening. It's seen as a healthy and rewarding hobby.

- Do many people grow vegetables in your city?
  - In my city, which is quite urban, it's not common for everyone to have a garden. However, you can find community gardens in some neighbourhoods, and many residents grow small plants like herbs or tomatoes on their balconies.

- Do you think it's easy to grow vegetables?
  - It really depends on the type of vegetable. Some, like tomatoes or lettuce, are relatively easy for beginners. Others can be quite challenging and require specific knowledge about soil, sunlight, and pests. So, it's a learning process.

- Should schools teach students how to grow vegetables?
  - Absolutely, I think it's a fantastic idea. It would teach children valuable lessons about where their food comes from, patience, and responsibility. It could also encourage healthier eating habits and an appreciation for nature.

- Are you interested in growing vegetables and fruits?
  - Yes, I'm quite interested. I've tried growing some basil and chili peppers on my windowsill. I find it very relaxing and satisfying to be able to eat something I've nurtured myself. I'd love to have a proper garden someday.


### Museum

- Do you think museums are important?
  - Yes, absolutely. I believe museums are vital as they preserve our cultural heritage and history for future generations. They provide a space for education and inspiration, allowing people to learn about art, science, and history in an engaging way. Furthermore, they play a key role in bringing communities together.

- Are there many museums in your hometown?
  - My hometown is a medium-sized city, so we have a few museums, but not a huge number. The most prominent one is a natural museum that shows messages about local volcano. They are quite popular and often host school trips and local events.

- Do you often visit a museum?
  - Not as often as I'd like to, to be honest. I usually visit a museum when I'm travelling to a new city, as I enjoy exploring their local exhibitions. In my daily life, I tend to go only when there's a special exhibition that catches my interest.

- When was the last time you visited a museum?
  - The last time I visited a museum was about two months ago. I went to Beijing and spent an afternoon at their radio history museum, which had a fascinating exhibition on amateur radio equipments. It was a really enjoyable and educational experience.


### Advertisement

- Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?
  - Yes, definitely. I vividly remember a public service advertisement about protecting the environment. It showed a crying polar bear on a melting iceberg, which really shocked me as a child. It made me aware of climate change for the first time, and that message has stuck with me ever since.

- Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport?
  - Oh, absolutely. Public transport is filled with ads, especially in trains and buses. You see posters above the seats, digital screens near the doors, and even advertisements on the tickets. It's almost impossible to avoid them during a commute.

- Do you like advertisements?
  - It really depends. I appreciate creative and entertaining ads that tell a story or make me laugh. However, I find most ads repetitive and intrusive, especially online pop-ups. So, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with them.

- What kind of advertising do you like?
  - I particularly like humorous or emotionally touching ads, such as those from brands like Coca-Cola or Apple. They focus on storytelling rather than just pushing a product. Also, I prefer short, clever video ads that get straight to the point without wasting time.


### Borrowing/lending

- Have you borrowed books from others?
  - Yes, I have. I often borrow books from my friends, especially when we’re studying the same subject. It’s a great way to share knowledge and save money. Plus, it gives us something interesting to discuss later.

- Have you ever borrowed money from others?
  - Yes, but only on rare occasions for small amounts. For example, if I forget my wallet when going out with friends, I might borrow some cash to pay for lunch. I always make sure to pay them back as soon as possible.

- Do you like to lending things to others?
  - Generally, I don’t mind lending things to people I trust. If a close friend needs something, like a book or class notes, I’m happy to help. But I prefer to avoid lending valuable items, just to be safe.

- How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?
  - It’s a bit frustrating, especially if the item was important to me. I try to give gentle reminders, but I also understand that people can forget. In the end, it’s taught me to be more careful about what I lend out.

### Describe an area/subject of science that you are interested in and would like to learn more about

You should say: Which area/subject it is; When and where you came to know this area/subject; How you get information about this area/subject; And explain why you are interested in this area/subject.

- The branch of science that fascinates me immensely and I’d love to delve deeper into is **Aerospace Science and Technology**, specifically the field of **micro/nano-satellites** and their **guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems**.

  I first came to know about this area during my sophomore year in university. I attended a guest lecture series hosted by our engineering department, where a professor from School of Astronautics gave a captivating talk on the advancements in China's space program. He showcased how microsatellites, some no bigger than a shoebox, are revolutionizing space exploration by making it more affordable and accessible.

  Since then, I’ve been actively seeking information about this subject. I primarily get my updates from online platforms. I follow dedicated journals like "Acta Astronautica" and the websites of space agencies like NASA and ESA. I’m also subscribed to several science communication channels on YouTube, such as "Scott Manley" and "Everyday Astronaut," which break down complex topics like orbital mechanics and attitude control in a very digestible way. Furthermore, I use academic databases like Google Scholar to read papers on specific GNC algorithms.

  The reason I’m so interested in this field is twofold. Firstly, I find the miniaturization of technology utterly fascinating. The idea that we can pack sophisticated sensors, propulsion systems, and computers into such a small package to perform tasks once reserved for massive, expensive satellites is a testament to human ingenuity. Secondly, the **guidance, navigation, and control** aspect is like the brain of the satellite. I'm intrigued by the complex algorithms that allow these tiny satellites to maintain their precise orientation (attitude) and orbit in the harsh environment of space, avoiding collisions and fulfilling their missions. This intersection of cutting-edge software and hardware represents, for me, the pinnacle of engineering and a key to unlocking the future of space commerce and research.

- Why do some children not like learning science at school?

  - I think the main reason is that science is sometimes presented as a collection of dry facts and complicated formulas to be memorized, rather than a dynamic process of discovery. If the teaching method lacks hands-on experiments or fails to connect the concepts to real-world, exciting applications, it can easily seem abstract and boring to children. A poor foundation or a fear of finding it too difficult can also deter them early on.

- Is it important to study science at school?

  - Absolutely, it's fundamental. Studying science isn't just about learning facts; it's about cultivating a way of thinking. It teaches students critical thinking, problem-solving, and how to analyze evidence objectively. These skills are valuable in any career. Furthermore, it helps everyone understand the world around them, from how their smartphone works to making informed decisions about climate change or public health issues.

- Which science subject is the most important for children to learn?

  - It's difficult to single out one as the "most" important, as they often interconnect. However, if I had to choose, I'd say a strong foundation in **general science** that introduces key concepts from biology, chemistry, and physics is crucial at a young age. This gives children a broad understanding of the natural world. Later, perhaps **computer science** is becoming increasingly vital due to our digital age, but a well-rounded knowledge is ideal.

- Should people continue to study science after graduating from school?

  - Yes, I believe they should. Scientific discovery doesn't stand still; it's constantly evolving. Continuing to engage with science, even informally through documentaries, news articles, or podcasts, helps people stay informed about new technologies, medical breakthroughs, and environmental challenges. This lifelong learning is essential for being an engaged and responsible citizen in a world increasingly shaped by science and technology.

- How do you get to know about scientific news?

  - I use a combination of sources. I have a few go-to websites like "Science Daily" and "Phys.org" for quick updates. I also follow specific scientists and science communicators on social media platforms like Twitter. For deeper dives, I listen to podcasts like "The Infinite Monkey Cage" or watch documentaries. This multi-source approach helps me get a balanced and engaging view of the latest developments.

- Should scientists explain the research process to the public?

  - Yes, without a doubt. Transparency is key to building public trust, especially for research that uses public funding or addresses controversial topics. Explaining the process – the hypotheses, the peer-review, the methods – demystifies science and helps people understand that it's a rigorous, self-correcting process, not just a set of opinions.
